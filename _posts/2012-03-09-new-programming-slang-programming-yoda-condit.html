<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><strong>Yoda Conditions</strong><br /> The act of using <em>if (constant == variable)</em> instead of natural <em>if (variable == constant),</em>; for example, <em>if (4 == foo)</em>. Because it is like "if it is the blue &ndash; this is the sky" or "if that is tall &ndash; this is a man."

<p>There's some really funny ones in this article, but in my C/C++ days "Yoda Conditions" were a best practice because it was all too easy to omit one of the '=' and turn a boolean expression into an assignment --  if( count = 5 ).. would set count to 5 and the expression would return true.  if( 5 = count ) would outright fail at compile time since you can't change the value of a <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">content</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">constant</span>.  Getting into the habit of doing Yoda Conditions help reduce this risk. :)</p>
<p>Further down this list of slang, I also liked "Fear Driven Development".  Its how I live my life!</p>
