<p>
<p>If you were going to make an OS, it makes sense to start with <i>something</i> rather than re-invent the wheel. Linux is an awesome OS but is <i>still</i>, after all these years, kind of rough around the edges for an end user Desktop environment. It really seems like Desktop Linux needs someone to take it that last mile.&nbsp; Someone needs to give it that last bit of refinement that makes the user experience truly enjoyable.</p>
<p>
<p>Google could do this, but why? Where's the pay off? As much as I'd love for <i>anyone</i> to get Desktop Linux to where <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a> is today, I just don't see it happening. It would seem to make more sense for Google to develop a cross-platform thin client (<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox</a> + <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">web 2.0</a>) that accesses Google <b><i>Ads</i></b> .. and services.</p>
