<p>A story from AP Mobile:</p>
<p><a href="http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_16026/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=2Zs4auUy">Online TV spats mean fewer free shows on Web</a></p>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Broadcast TV seems to want to follow the music industry down the sordid contentious path of fighting and screwing their customers. The music industry yielded to technology and so will broadcasters. Yes, customers may want free but if you make it convenient enough for them, they will pay .. A little. Better to embrace the ways in which they want to consume your media rather than force them into walled garden like cattle. Until then torrents, TiVo, and Netflix will fill the gap.&nbsp;</div>
