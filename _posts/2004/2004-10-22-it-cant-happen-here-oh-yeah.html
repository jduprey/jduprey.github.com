<div class="entry-content">Here are the lyrics to one of my favorite songs.
<p /><strong>Pop Will Eat Itself - Dos Dedos Mis Amigos - Ich Bin Ein Auslander</strong>
<p />"<em>Listen to the victim, abused by the system <br />The basis is racist, you know that we must face this. <br />"It can't happen here". Oh yeah? <br />"Take a look around at the cities and the towns."
<p />See them hunting, creeping, sneaking, <br />Breeding fear and loathing with the lies they're speaking. <br />The knife, the gun, broken bottle, petrol bomb: <br /><strong>There is no future when the past soon come. </strong>
<p />And when they come to ethnically cleanse me, <br />Will you speak out? Will you defend me? <br />Or laugh through a glass eye as they rape our lives, <br /><strong>Trampled underfoot by the right on the rise. </strong>
<p />Ich Bin Ein Auslander.
<p /><strong>Welcome to a state where the politics of hate </strong><br />Shout loud in the crowd "Watch them beat us all down" <br />There's a rising tide in the rivers of blood <br /><strong>But if the answer isn't violence, neither is your silence. </strong>
<p />If they come to ethnically cleanse me, <br />will you speak out? Will you defend me? <br />Freedom of expression doesn't make it alright <br />Trampled underfoot by the rise of the right. </em>"
<p />"Ich Bin Ein Auslander" - I am an outsider?
<p />While I'm pretty sure they had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">nazism</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">fascism</a>) in mind when they wrote the song, it has always conjured visions of an America that has forgotten the "high ideals" of the <a href="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html" title="We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.">constitution</a>.  Can anyone identify the signs?  Suspension of due process?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism" title="...a period of intense anticommunism, also known as the (second) Red Scare, which occurred in the United States from 1948 to about 1956 (or later), when the government of the United States actively persecuted the Communist Party USA, its leadership, and others suspected of being communists.">McArthyism</a> or Terrorist witch hunts?  Misguided aggression towards unfriendly foreign nations?
