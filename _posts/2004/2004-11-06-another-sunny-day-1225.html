<p>We see it on TV, we get calls on the phone <br />By the prophets of doom, they won't leave us alone. <br />The planet is dying and there's no time to spare. <br />They spend all our days sowing seeds of despair. <br />We get enough bad news to harden our hearts. <br />This fear that we feed on is what's keeping us apart. <br />To say that we're doomed is just an obvious remark. <br />And it don't make you right, it just keeps you in the dark.

<p>I don't want to live angry, I don't want to live scared. <br />I don't need no more prophets crying "brother beware." <br />just put some work in my hands and give me a dollar to spare. <br />And don't let me sow those seeds of despair.

<p>Well, this earth is a graveyard, it will swallow our bones. <br />It was here long before us, It will be here when we're gone. <br />And it's a vain generation that looks for a sign. <br />Don't you think we could make better use of our time. <br />Yeah, the air could be cleaner and the water could too. <br />But what we do to each other are the worst things that we do. <br />And we can treasure our freedom behind our locked doors. <br />But God speed the day when we're lonely no more.
