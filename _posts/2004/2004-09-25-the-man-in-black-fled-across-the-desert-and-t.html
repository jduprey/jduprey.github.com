<div class="entry-content">"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed."&nbsp; This was the opening sentence of the first book in Dark Tower / Gunslinger series by Stephen King.&nbsp; The books intensity and pace did not waver from start to finish.&nbsp; I read it as a teenager, 1988'ish, and it really captured my imagination.
<p />In short, the story is about one man's quest, the gunslinger, to catch the "man in black" and save the "Dark Tower."&nbsp; The Dark Tower is some sort of nexus of power for all that exists.&nbsp; The tower is falling and, with it, existence.&nbsp; Roland Deschain is the last gunslinger, a kind of Arthurian knight, who has vowed to save the tower or die trying.&nbsp; He has vowed to "..remember the face of his father well."&nbsp;
<p />His singular purpose makes him a ruthless and relentless enemy.&nbsp; The gunslinger always reminded me of a more human <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">Terminator</a> and his confusingly anachronistic world always left me&nbsp; wondering.&nbsp; I hungrily read "The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three,"&nbsp; but that was it for me and the gunslinger for a long while.&nbsp; I started college in '91 and forgot about the quest.&nbsp; This year, I picked up the series again, re-reading the first two books along with the five I hadn't read.&nbsp;
<p />In the books some of Kings other characters have made guest appearances - including those from the <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/pages/works/stand/">The Stand</a> and <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/pages/works/salems_lot">Salem's Lot</a>.&nbsp; Stephen King even wrote himself into book 6 ("Song of Susannah").&nbsp; Some may find that to be vain, but I found it rather charming and it gave the author a chance to draw a picture of his younger self.&nbsp; I suspect there may have been some self-help therapy going on in those pages.
<p />King started the series in 1970, but the gunslinger story sat collecting dust for many years.&nbsp; He had intended the series to be HIS epic adventure - akin to Lord of the Rings.&nbsp; He started the story when he was young and very ambitious - even before the likes of <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/pages/works/Carrie/">Carrie</a> and <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/pages/works/stand/">The Stand</a>.
<p />Stephen King's final book in the series, "Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower," was released this week - Tuesday, Sept. 21.&nbsp; I purchased it tonight and can't wait to start it.&nbsp;
<p />You can learn more about the books from <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/DarkTower/">The Official Dark Tower Site</a>.  You can learn even more about the stories and get into the world of Roland by visiting the <a href="http://www.thedarktower.net/">Dark Tower fan site</a>.
<p />USA Today has covered the Dark Tower series a couple of times <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2003-06-18-king_x.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-09-22-dark-tower-main_x.htm">here</a>.
<p />"There they stood, ranged along the hillsides, met<br />To view the last of me, a living frame<br />For one more picture! In a sheet of flame<br />I saw them and I knew them all.&nbsp; And yet<br />Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,<br />And blew.&nbsp; 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.'" <br />-Child Roland, Robert Browning, 1855</div>
