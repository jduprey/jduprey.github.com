<div class="entry-content"><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/16/0351247">This article</a> on <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot.org</a> reports that Jon Stewart was on CNN's Crossfire.  John Stewart is the host of "<a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/">The Daily Show</a>."  Even though Stewart's show is a fake news show on the <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/">Comedy channel</a>, I still find it informative.  *Sometimes* it seems his show does more fact checking than *real* news shows.  Stewart appeared on the show to beg the news media to act as something more than free advertisement for the different political parties.
<p />In my opinion, ever since the <a href="http://www.iduprey.com/gallery/9_11_2001_USAttacked">9/11 attacks</a>, much of the mainstream media has really fallen down the slippery slope of biased news coverage.  However, this may have been true long before 9/11, but I cared less about it then.  These days I rely on <a href="http://www.npr.org/">National Public Radio</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/news/news.jsp">BBC</a> for news.. when I crawl out of my hole to actually read news.

But what is American democracy? In AMERICA (THE BOOK), Jon Stewart and The Daily Show writing staff offer their insights into our unique system of government, dissecting its institutions, explaining its history and processes, and exploring the reasons why concepts like one man, one vote, government by the people, and every vote counts have become such popular urban myths. Topics include: Ancient Rome: The First Republicans; The Founding Fathers: Young, Gifted, and White; The Media: Can it Be Stopped?; and more! "</div>
