<p>All I can say is "About Time"!  In my minimal testing, it seems to work.  I tested on OS X (10.6.8).  I found that with Maven 3.02 setting JAVA_HOME was not enough.  I think there may be a bug in the mvn script with paths that have spaces in them?  After looking at the script, I found that setting JAVACMD="$JAVA_HOME"/bin/java that maven then worked as expected.</p>
