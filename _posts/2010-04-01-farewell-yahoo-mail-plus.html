<div>Farewell Yahoo! Mail Plus. &nbsp;I've been a Mail Plus customer since 2002, but I'm just not that into you anymore. &nbsp;I like&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap">IMAP</a>&nbsp;and there are better, cheaper solutions out there. &nbsp;I would have cancelled you sooner had I not been so lazy. &nbsp;This year I made sure to update all acounts that once used you. &nbsp;I wish you the best... really.</div>
