I volunteered to help with an intro to programming class for 6-8'th graders at work.  I had been trying to teach M. some programming at home and I thought it might be interesting to be part of a larger effort.  It has rekindled my interest in Python.  

Python has been my go-to scripting language if I can't do it in bash and standard 'Nix tools like sed and awk.  However, I'm not really all that familiar the language's features.  So [like learning the R](https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata) language earlier this year, I've taken it the challenge of doing a "real" program with it.  More to come on this later.  Above is a screen grab of an easter egg hidden in python which attempts to capture the python design mantra - The Zen of Python.
