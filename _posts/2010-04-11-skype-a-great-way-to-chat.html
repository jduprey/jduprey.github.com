<p>Many of us at work started using <a href="http://www.skype.com" title="Skype Home" target="_blank">Skype</a> to IM and to be able to look at each other while we talk. &nbsp;Skype allows voice, video chats and even allows you to share your desktop. &nbsp;While the desktop sharing is not so useful due to the visual quality, its just fine for lossy video and sound. &nbsp;The encrypted chats are a nice alternative to our internal, and proprietary, chat system which barely supports Macs. &nbsp;(Nearly half our group is using Macs now.) &nbsp;We still use <a href="http://www.webex.com/" title="WebEx" target="_blank">WebEx</a> for our larger meetings, presentations etc which also supports video and desktop sharing. &nbsp;With Web-Ex the desktop sharing is actually useable and you can have more than a two-way video conference. &nbsp;I believe <a href="http://www.webex.com/" title="WebEx" target="_blank">WebEx</a> supports up to four.? &nbsp;We also have a professional video/telepresence solution called <a href="http://www.lifesize.com/" title="LifeSize" target="_blank">LifeSize</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm thinking of getting my relatives to use Skype now too. &nbsp;It is so easy to connect with full voice and video. &nbsp;Skype is free to use so that cost of entry is a download and install.</p>
<p>As with e-mail, the web, and all your other Internet facing apps, there is an element of spam and phishing and other hazards to look out for. &nbsp;Just this morning I had a chat message from "Request Support" that indicated I had a "Windows" problem that needed my attention. &nbsp;Funny, because I don't use Windows anywhere!</p>

<p>I was a little surprised that I got this message because I thought that I had set permissions to only allow IM's from people in my contact list. &nbsp;I hadn't! &nbsp;So the first thing I did was change that:
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/skype_permissions-scaled1000.png"><img alt="Skype_permissions" height="501" src="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/skype_permissions-scaled1000.png?w=300" width="500" /></a></div></p>
<p>The next thing I did was right click on "Request Support" and blocked them and I checked "Report abuse from this person":&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Skype_block" height="276" src="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/skype_block-scaled500.png?w=300" width="500" /></div>
<p>Out of curiosity, in a sandboxed environment, I went the the web site this phishing scam was trying to get me to go to:</p>
<p>
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/screen_shot_2010-04-11_at_12-00-47_pm-scaled1000.png"><img alt="Screen_shot_2010-04-11_at_12" height="408" src="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/screen_shot_2010-04-11_at_12-00-47_pm-scaled1000.png?w=300" width="500" /></a></div></p>
<p>It produced a window that looked like a genuine Windows scanner of some sort, faked progress, then reported I had all sorts serious problems. &nbsp;Then they dump you to a "shopping cart" etc. etc. &nbsp;Nothing notable, really, just be ware that Skype has the same pitfalls the rest of the 'Net has. &nbsp;Set your permissions accordingly and you will be insulated from much of it. &nbsp;As always don't click links from strangers!</p>
<p>Feel free to add me to your Skype list!</p>
