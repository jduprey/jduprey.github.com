<p>Its been MONTHS since I visited google Wave. Its a huge resource hog so I don't leave it open like e-mail. I had about 20 unread messages to catch up on. I also discovered that google wave now supports e-mail notifications so you don't have keeping loading up the bloated thing just to see if there are new posts. Second, when using Google Chrome web browser, it doesn't take up nearly as much memory. Google Chrome (and its child procs) seem to take up about 200M. Safari, 665M. Chrome is also much faster and seems to render Wave better.
<p /> It also appears that you can remove people from Waves.. but what about your contacts?
<p /> The e-mail thing will definitely encourage me to use it more.</p>
