<p>July 25, 1992 I had just finished my freshman year of college. My Dad had died that spring after years of illness. These were perhaps my most difficult years full of soul searching, debauchery, and other sinful behavior all in the name of exercising those demons of childhood. All ancient history... <br />&nbsp;<br />While recreating my digital music library for the twenty first century (256 kbps, mp3 still), I came across my Guns N' Roses "Use Your Illusion II" CD cover. (My generation still calls them album covers.) Sandwiched between the plastic case and the cover was a ticket stub and a locket of hair.</p>

<p>The ticket stub is from the "Monster Tour" starring Guns N' Roses and Metallica. Faith No More opened for them. I remember very little from the concert which, in those days, meant you were doing it right. GNR of course rocked the house. In their traditional fashion, they showed up on stage late. The crowd managed to amuse themselves with the help of the camera crew. Ladies, and I use that term loosely, would take turns flashing their breasts to the camera crew who, in turn, put them up on the jumbo monitors. The crowed would cheer, or jeer, in a voting method not so dissimilar from American Idol. <br />&nbsp;<br />Anyone else attend this legendary concert? Share what you remember here! <br />&nbsp;<br />... oh and the locket of hair.. that came just a little later. It was donated by my girlfriend my sophomore year. MANY years later, I married that girl. The rest really is history. :)</p>
