<p>Sometimes, I'm particularly proud to work for Thomson Reuters.&nbsp; I've always been impressed with their policy on diversity - whether it be for gender, sexual orientation or those with special needs.&nbsp; In my experience with the company, talented and hard working people are valued above all else.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was approached&nbsp;to help promote Thomson Reuters "It Gets Better" story, I was not only willing but proud to do so.&nbsp; However, I'm not a very politically correct person.&nbsp; I fear I may totally botch the message.&nbsp; Please feel free to send your corrections along and I'll make amends.&nbsp; Here goes..</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.itgetsbetter.org/">It Gets Better project</a> is an effort to reach out to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth through personal video testimonials about how there is hope for them in an often LGBT intolerant world.&nbsp; These videos are touching and inspirational personal accounts of how individuals have suffered, sometimes extraordinarily so, survived, healed, and eventually thrived in a world that is still intolerant of these differences.&nbsp; The videos are messages of hope.&nbsp; And Thomson Reuters' video showcases many of our own colleagues' stories.</p>

<p>According to internal communications:</p>

<p>I would like to thank EVERYONE on the video for taking the time and having the courage to share something so personal.</p>
<p>This is a video that I am proud to share not only with my colleagues but with my friends and family.&nbsp; For those suffering from bias, discrimination, and hate, I pray that it brings hope to you.&nbsp; For those who have never experienced bias and hate, I hope it opens your eyes and your hearts.</p>
