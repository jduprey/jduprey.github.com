<p>Zen is a form of meditation with a focus on the mindful awareness of the present moment. In common lexicon, the phrase "being zen" or "having a zen attitude" has come to mean viewing life calmly with equanimity. By this definition, being Zen is about doing right for the mind, body, and soul. It can help you relax, have a positive outlook on life, and find a higher plane of spiritual worth.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to just let go and and look at life with a bit of indifference.  My troubles are small, my fortunes are great.  Let what will be, be.  Hand wringing and worrying will do more harm than good. I shall meditate upon this while I review some code and await other, more personal, news.</p>
