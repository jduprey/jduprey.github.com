<div>Emma, my four year-old, is aware of the Mac "Activity Monitor" utility. &nbsp;Mine is set to display RAM usage as pie chart in the dock. &nbsp;Whenever she comes to "bother me" at the computer she usually comments on how much green I have. &nbsp;She also knows less green means&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webkinz.com">Webkinz</a>&nbsp;starts up slower. &nbsp;She wanted to know why. &nbsp;I explained:&nbsp;</div>
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jduprey/5XMraVOtM64Jje74BMEgTOnVBoz6lTOFIdySaUdnd7Gz6Xo7eBUowPSpj9oG/49621fbabae9ecaf2e88b6acdfdb36.jpeg"><img alt="49621fbabae9ecaf2e88b6acdfdb36" height="304" src="http://getfile0.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jduprey/g1lqqp2o4eCdUWY7iOIyH1G8sHSxZzQunRUWYSQQDMDzxLBflz2nz8IuO12A/49621fbabae9ecaf2e88b6acdfdb36.jpeg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a></div>
<p />
<div>I think she got it. &nbsp;I happened to have a some spare hard drives lying around so she could look at and touch one. &nbsp;I also pointed out the clicking noise she was hearing was the hard drive. &nbsp;Then I slid off my Mac Pro's cover and showed her where they were in the computer... &nbsp;I think she kinda got it - computers have to read programs (like Webkinz) into memory from disk. &nbsp;Disk is slow, RAM is fast. &nbsp;:)</div>
<p />
<div>She's starting to read a little and can do basic addition and subtraction. &nbsp;In a few months when she is better, I think I will introduce her to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Turtle Logo</a>. &nbsp;Too early?</div>
