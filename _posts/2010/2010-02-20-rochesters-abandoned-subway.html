<div><span style="font-family:arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">Abby and her geocaching friends decided to find a geocache in the abandoned Rochester subway. Our numbers dwindled as people discovered the no trespassing signs. Honestly, what did they expect.. and why did they bring their children? It was cold. We did not get arrested, mugged or murdered, thank goodness. We also failed to find the cache because construction inside the tunnel had put up large chain link fences from floor to ceiling. They will likely be filling in the subway with cement or something: <a href="http://www.broadstreetcorridor.com/">http://www.broadstreetcorridor.com/</a></span></div>
