<p>Starting today, we are making Google Wave openly available to everyone as part of Google Labs. You no longer need an invitation to wave -- simply visit <a href="http://wave.google.com/">wave.google.com</a> and sign right in. Likewise, if you are a Google Apps administrator at a business, school or organization, you can now <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/wave.html">easily enable Google Wave</a> for all your users at no extra cost (more on our <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-wave-labs-available-today-to.html">Enterprise blog</a>).</p>
