<p>I just received an e-mail from Clear Wireless which offers WiMax (4G) and 3G wireless access, in home with VOIP option as well as mobile.  The prices look comparable to TimeWarner cables internet access with the benefit of having a wireless option.  For me, it would be a wash in terms of savings, but I like the idea of having a choice and I like the idea of getting mobile Internet far cheaper than any else is offering.  I wonder how reliable this service is in the Rochester, NY area?  Any Rochester Clear customers care to comment?</p>
