<div>As I noted, my little girl turned five last week. &nbsp;We celebrate, again, with all her little friends this coming Friday. &nbsp;A friend commented on the <a href="http://blog.iduprey.com/emmas-fifth-birthday">birthday photos</a> I posted and how big she was getting. &nbsp;It really is amazing! &nbsp;Five short, barely perceptible, years ago she was the football-sized "proto-human" pictured below - totally messing with my concept of self.. and my sleep patterns. &nbsp;</div>

<div>Today she is my little buddy, my longest term wetware programming assignment, my stubbornest opponent, my shard of immortality.. &nbsp;She changed how my wife and I view the future and united us as a couple and as a family in ways more profound than marriage vows or quiet nights alone ever could.&nbsp;</div>

<div>It certainly was more comfortable when my wife and I were completely self contained units. &nbsp;Since childhood we've learned to build up walls to protect ourselves from the cold harsh realities of life. &nbsp;(Unfortunately, these same walls often keep us distant from the ones that we love too.) &nbsp;Now a very innocent and, in some ways, fragile part of ourselves is exposed again. &nbsp;It has opened me up in ways not experienced since childhood. &nbsp;I'm closer to my wife and loved ones because of it.</div>
<p />
<div>These "revelations" have got me thinking a lot about the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition">human condition</a>. &nbsp;I used to dislike people, in general. &nbsp;Really. &nbsp;I used to be agnostic at best. &nbsp;These days, I feel more.. spiritual. &nbsp;I feel like all my grievances with organized religion(s) have been, somewhat, petty in the grand scheme of things.</div>
<p />
<div>Anyway, to make a long story short. &nbsp;The birth of my daughter was the start of something great - a fork in the road I'm glad I took. &nbsp;I am in total awe of this life, the human condition, and all that it means - not that I completely comprehend it. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I'm truly blessed by God and I give thanks.</div>
