<p>This is awesome.  I hope he has a great turn out.  I honestly don't think I can make it, because, like he said reasonable people have work (or are looking for work) and families to care for.  Never the less, I hope it gets some attention and makes people think a bit.  If we DON'T take it down a notch, America is going to tear itself apart.  We all have differences, but its the machinery at work that is fanning the flames beyond reason.</p>
