<p>Emma had her first soccer practice today. It was a beautiful morning for it - well into the 70's by the time we left, I believe. I was happy to see how friendly the coaches were and patient with the children. I think this will be a good first introduction to soccer. More importantly, it will keep her active and healthy. Its great for my health too. With the exception of having to be on the field by 8:30, I get a lot of enjoyment out of watching the kids.
