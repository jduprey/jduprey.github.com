<p>Emma asked a great question this week, "Why do boats float?" &nbsp;I said "Great question!" &nbsp;Then I started to ramble about buoyancy and realized I had no coherent explanation myself. &nbsp;So I googled it, then she and I performed experiments. &nbsp;In a nutshell, the way I explained it to her is:</p>
<div>
<ol class="MailOutline">
<li>Things put in water displace the water. &nbsp;(Good examples were of her in the bath tub.)</li>
<li>For something to float, it must displace the same amount of water, in weight, as itself.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div><!--more-->&nbsp;</div>
<div>I attempted to demonstrate the buoyant force be putting a large measuring cup of water on our scale and showed that if I pushed a smaller bowl into the cup flat side down, it displaced more water and caused more buoyant force than if I put it in edge first, letting the water enter the bowl. &nbsp;This was reinforced by the numbers on the scale. &nbsp;I think this was largely lost on her. &nbsp;Then we took 2 pennies and weighed them - 1/8 oz. &nbsp;I asked her if we put them in the water, would they float. &nbsp;She said no. &nbsp;Then I let her test it out. &nbsp;They sank. &nbsp;I then tried to get her to figure out a way to make them float.. I rambled on about melting them down and making a shape that would displace more water that I don't think she got. &nbsp;Then we used some aluminum foil and played around with making boats to see which shapes, etc. would work and which didn't and talked about why. &nbsp;Its too early to tell, but maybe she got it. &nbsp;We also talked about the guy who figured out why boats float - Archimedes. &nbsp;What fun she had in mutilating his name. &nbsp;:)</div>

<div>Emma also offered to help me out at work. &nbsp;I asked her if she could program and she said no, so I offered to teach her. &nbsp;She had her first&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>&nbsp;lesson this weekend. &nbsp;Logo was the first language I was introduced to in Elementary school - on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ii">Apple II</a>. &nbsp;I only had a few lessons before they stopped for some reason, but I remember the excitement I had for programming even back then... &nbsp;</div>

<div>Here is a house we made:</div>

<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Pastedgraphic-1" height="421" src="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jduprey/GpPEe1LQmtPlcz8AGcgbwzghMukKm0z6KVpgPd2kF8z8pUhI9FdKFws6Zd6u/PastedGraphic-1.tiff.converted.jpg" width="244" /></div>
</div>
<p />
<div>She was mostly interested in seeing the pictures *I* could make rather making her own, but its a start. &nbsp;I introduced "functions" (making your own commands) and "variables" - there's a powerful concept to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a>&nbsp;early on! &nbsp;She really enjoyed the "box" function I created along with the repeat command to iteratively draw the boxes. &nbsp;She insisted on printing those to take to class. &nbsp;:)</div>
<div>
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Pastedgraphic-2" height="331" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jduprey/6cXzI3gT2N0a3gjNrm0r97FNMKRcmyUZ2CdWowjiASopd0RVwnQXDhMwNdoP/PastedGraphic-2.tiff.converted.jpg" width="334" /></div>
</div>
<div>These pictures were made with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alancsmith.co.uk/logo/">ACSLogo</a>&nbsp;for the Mac. &nbsp;Its a great free program. &nbsp;I have to admit, I was still playing with it well after Emma had run off to play with her friends.</div>
