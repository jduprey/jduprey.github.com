<p>Dropbox (<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">http://www.dropbox.com</a>) won best Internet application and I can't agree more.  I'm extremely impressed with how well this file sync'ing service works.  Its a real life saver for people whose lives seem to be temporarily interrupted as they move from one computer to the next.  Kidding aside.  Its nice to leave work for the day knowing that the document I've been working on will be waiting for me at home on my desktop, laptop, and my iPhone.  Its free for 2G of storage.  I pay $50 a year for 50G.  It blows Apples iDisk away.  Apple is just barely keeping me as a Mobile Me customer.  If they were smart they'd buy Dropbox for gobs of money.</p>
<p>Watch the video: <br /><a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/3846837">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/3846837</a></p>
<p>Posterous (<a href="http://posterous.com">http://posterous.com</a>) was in the same list, and I have to say this is the first blogging service that truly made blogging easy.  The cost of entry is as simple as sending an e-mail.</p>
<p>Scanning the rest of the list, I'd highly recommend taking Chrome (<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome)">http://www.google.com/chrome)</a> for a spin.  It is the fastest browser I've ever seen.  It would be my primary browser on my Mac if 1Password (<a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password)">http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password)</a>, Evernote (<a href="http://www.evernote.com/)">http://www.evernote.com/)</a>, and Xmarks (<a href="http://www.xmarks.com/)">http://www.xmarks.com/)</a> integration was there.  I rely heavily on these apps and browser integration is a must.</p>
<p>Lastly, facebook (<a href="http://facebook.com">http://facebook.com</a>).  As if I even need to cite the link.  It seems 2009 was the year of facebook.  EVERYONE joined it and THAT is what made it worth my time - one place to communicate with my friends and family in an e-social setting.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to dropbox, congratulations and I look forward to new features this year!</p>
