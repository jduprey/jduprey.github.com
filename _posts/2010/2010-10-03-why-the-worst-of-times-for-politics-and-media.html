<p>NYMag has a great article on Jon Stewart and the Daily Show.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Georgia, Garamond, Times, Times New Roman, serif;line-height:20px;">&ldquo;Jon has chronicled the death of shame in politics and journalism,&rdquo; says Brian Williams, the&nbsp;<em>NBC Nightly News</em>&nbsp;anchor who is a frequent&nbsp;<em>Daily Show</em>&nbsp;guest. &ldquo;Many of us on this side of the journalism tracks often wish we were on Jon&rsquo;s side. I envy his platform to shout from the mountaintop. He&rsquo;s a necessary branch of government.&rdquo; --&nbsp;</span><a href="http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/68086/?xrs=synd_twitter">nymag.com</a></p>
