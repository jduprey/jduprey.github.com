<p>Dailyburn has some new features.  I used this site last year to lose nearly 30 lbs.  I'm currently using <a href="http://fitbit.com">http://fitbit.com</a> to maintain my weight and track my activity level... along with <a href="http://runkeeper.com">http://runkeeper.com</a> and <a href="http://connect.garmin.com">http://connect.garmin.com</a>.  Dailyburn recently release a multi-tiered pricing scheme which I don't really care for - especially when some of the core features clearly need work.  They could take a page from Fitbits UI design and make the food/calorie entering process easier.</p>
