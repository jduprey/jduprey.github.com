<p>Thanks to @scott for this one.  Everyday, I have to decide how much time to spend at work versus with my family.  Finding a balance I can live with is the challenge.  With Emma growing up so fast, I worry it will be one of my regrets at the end.</p>
<p>Its natural to have regrets at the end, and I think we could all take this list to heart.  That said, these common regrets, at one extreme, could be boiled down to "I wish life wasn't so hard.  I wish I didn't have to choose between what I loved and what I wanted versus what was required of me to ensure my family and I survives and thrives."</p>
