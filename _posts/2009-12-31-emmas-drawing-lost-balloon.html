<p>"Emma has had a fear of losing her balloons ever since she gave one to her mother to hold and she lost it. Now, she does NOT let her mother hold her helium balloons and I must swear to not let go of it before I am allowed to. She recently created this rather advanced drawing of her losing a balloon (on the right). But she conjures another balloon on the left to take its place. I particularly like the time lapse effect she created for the escaping balloon. She continues to amaze me with her creativity!"</p>
