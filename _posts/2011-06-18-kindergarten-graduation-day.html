<p>Emma graduated from kindergarten today. &nbsp;Its hard to believe another milestone has been reached. &nbsp;It &nbsp;seems like yesterday that she nervously waited for the bus to arrive for her first real day of school.</p>

<p>She's grown much since then. &nbsp;She has learned a lot at her new school - about God, life, and of course traditional educational topics like reading&nbsp;and math. &nbsp;She received an award for reading the most books - 720 of them throughout the year. &nbsp;Now since she is reading full chapter books, like Trixie Beldon, Magic Treehouse, and classics like Charlotte's web, the teachers agreed each chapter would be considered a book. &nbsp;Am I bragging? &nbsp;Am I proud? &nbsp;You bet. &nbsp;Apologies and gratitude go out to my friends and family for enduring our constant bragging about her strong points and apparent blindness to her.. weaker areas. &nbsp;We are proud parents and can't help ourselves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway the graduation ceremony was very nice and driven largely by the students recitals and songs.</p>

<p>After graduation, we took Emma and one of her school friends and mom out to lunch. &nbsp;I went to work, while the rest had a play date.</p>
<p>That evening I asked Emma what she thought of kindergarten and moving on to first grade. &nbsp;She shrugged and said it was "OK", but she really wanted to go back to pre-school. &nbsp;She liked to play, <a href="http://blog.iduprey.com/turkerina-balurkey-turkey-in-disguise">do artwork</a>, and she loved the friendly teachers (the nuns are less friendly, I suppose). &nbsp;I sympathized but told her there is no going back. &nbsp;We can cheerish our memories, but we have to accept that change is inevitable - that we should look forward to the new adventures that life has for us. &nbsp;She agreed, begrudgingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I dropped these sage words of wisdom, I secretly wished I could freeze time, even go back a bit, and savor the purity and sweetness of M's childhood just a little longer. &nbsp;I selfishly considered that with each of her passing milestones, marks the decline and relevance of myself.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>will</em> all have <a href="http://blog.iduprey.com/?tag=family">our memories</a> and there <strong>are</strong> spectacular adventures to be had yet. &nbsp;If life is a journey, does it make any sense to regret the parts that have already passed and missing the parts that are happening right now or those that are soon to be?</p>
