<div>My Mac Pro's&nbsp;<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/mice/apple-mighty-mouse/4505-3148_7-31470406.html">Mighty Mouse</a>&nbsp;has been replaced with a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002HWRJBM/ref=nosim/deliciousmons-20">Logitech Performance Mouse MX</a>. &nbsp;This mouse is extremely precise and comfortable to use. &nbsp;Had my Mighty Mouse's little nubby track ball not continually gummed up, I would have continued to use it happily. &nbsp;Since the mouse is completely sealed, the only way to REALLY clean it, in spite of what&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1537">Apple says</a>,&nbsp;is to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mightymouserepair.com/">break seals, then re-glue it after you have all the tiny little parts back in place</a>. &nbsp;After the second or third cleaning, enough was enough and&nbsp;after switching there's no way I could go back. &nbsp;</div>

<div>This purchase matches nicely with my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001U0WQJM/ref=nosim/deliciousmons-20">Logitech diNovo Edge keyboard</a>&nbsp;I bought a couple of months back. &nbsp;It replaced the stock wireless keyboard that came with my pre-2008 Mac Pro - the non-aluminum, acrylic backed one. &nbsp;Some of the white keys yellowed and I found the left shift key would often stick/catch/resist if you didn't hit it dead center. &nbsp;You can get the diNovo darned cheap, comparatively, from&nbsp;<a href="http://macmall.com/p/Logitech-Keyboards/product~dpno~7691664~pdp.fbffgfj">MacMall</a>. &nbsp;(I paid nearly full price for the mouse, but you can find it $10-$15 cheaper online from reputable sources.)</div>
