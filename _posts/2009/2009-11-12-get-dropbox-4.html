<p>Dropbox works incredibly well.  It is FAST to sync and I use it to keep my apps and docs available on all my Macs, my iPhone, and the web.  Get dropbox, there is a free version try out - 2 Gig limit.  <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">http://www.dropbox.com</a></p>
<p>Note: If you get a warning from Google or your antivirus about dropbox.com being a malware site.  You can safely ignore it.  Because dropbox hosts files for millions of users, and some of those users used it for malicious purposes, it got flagged.  Your use of dropbox is independent of all other users and you certainly won't get a virus from visiting the company site or your own files.  Dropbox has worked with Google to resolve the flagging of the whole site.</p>
