<p>According to the Wii Fit, today I am .2 lbs away from my personal goal of 157.2 lbs and the Wii Fit's recommended "ideal body weight" for me. That's a weight loss of 29.6 pounds since I started officially recording back in January.

<p>I have remained relatively quiet about my goal and progress, but as I approach THE milestone I had to give a shout out! Thanks to <a href="http://dailyburn.com/">http://dailyburn.com/</a> for helping me track my calories and my family for being supportive!
<p /> I'll post more on how I achieved my goal later...</p>
