<p>This Dilbert cartoon kinda hits home this year.. actually this quote is even closer:</p>
<div><span style="font-size:10pt;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size:10pt;"><b>Pointy Haired Boss</b>: In Japan employees occasionally work themselves to death. It's called Karoshi. I don't want that to happen to anybody in my department. The trick is to take a break as soon as you see a bright light and hear dead relatives beckon.&rdquo; -- <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dilbert">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dilbert</a></span> </div>
