<p />"She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever  surrenders: She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and  true courage. ... she never wounds 'till she has generously  given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against  the danger of treading on her."
<p />"I confess I was wholly at a loss what to make of the rattles, 'till I went back and counted them and found them just thirteen, exactly the number of the Colonies united in America; and I recollected too that this was the only part of the Snake which increased in numbers. ..."
<p />"'Tis curious and amazing to observe how distinct and independent of each other the rattles of this animal are, and yet how firmly they are united together, so as never  to be separated but by breaking them to pieces. One of  those rattles singly, is incapable of producing sound,  but the ringing of thirteen together, is sufficient to  alarm the boldest man living."
<p />These words are believed to have come from Benjamin Franklin.  I've often thought this flag is better suited for our nation as well.  I've made this emblem my user icon for politics.
