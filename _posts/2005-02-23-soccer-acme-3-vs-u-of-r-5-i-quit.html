<div class="entry-content">It was an ugly ugly night for soccer.  The ref. made a serious error and did not count a goal against us.  This may have contributed to the other teams angst.  At one point two of the players were penalized 2 minutes - leaving 3 on the field.  We got up by 2 or 3 points because of this.  Eventually one player got so unruly that he was red carded.  He then tried to pick a fight with us.  The ref. kicked him out of the building and called the police!  How exciting!
<p />I quit.  Our games are late - most have been 10PM or later.  Its about a 20+ minute drive to the facility.  And, oh yeah, I suck.  To top things off, I somehow managed to "exchange unpleasant words" with one of my own players after the game.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I used to love to play soccer, but this is stressful.   With a our first child on the way, I want a stress <em>reliever</em>, not a stress <em>maker</em>.  I don't like quitting, <em><strong>anything</strong></em>, so this wasn't an easy decision to make, but I made it quickly and I feel better already.</div>
