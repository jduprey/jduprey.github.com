<p><span style="font-family:Times, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:medium;"><a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Google-wave-logo" height="245" src="http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jduprey/iG8Mwt1xYtx2jmXcSjDNMw8oDY8xYu16vEq3Y1r3EJhNkEbLttfdXVrpLcfs/google-wave-logo.jpg" width="251" /></div>
<p></a><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">I've had my&nbsp;</span><a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Google wave</a><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;account for several weeks now, but I've only used it regularly for the first week.</span></span></p>
<div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:Times;"><br style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The google provided front end is a pretty ambitious web application that merges instant messaging, e-mail, and collaborative documentation (aka wiki) and discussion.&nbsp; Extensions allow for all sorts of other forms of collaboration - video conferencing, voting/polls, turn-based games, etc.&nbsp; Wave uses standard protocols on the backend (extensions to XMPP/Jabber) that will allow "</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_%28information_technology%29" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">federation</a><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">" or organization-hosted wave servers that interconnect with others - similar to how organizations host e-mail and web servers today. &nbsp;</span>
<p /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">To date, my experience is with the Google provided front-end and here are my impressions:</span><br style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" /></span></span><br />
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Real Time Editing Can Be Confusing</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Imagine five... or thirty of your colleagues all sitting at the same desk attempting to author the same document at the same time.&nbsp; No matter how talented the individual, the model eventaully breaks down and everyone starts stepping on each other's toes.&nbsp; The realtime document editing concept needs to be managed better in part by software and in part by proper netiquette.&nbsp; The software may be able to facilitate the netiquette using a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Moderator" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">moderator system</a><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;found in other sytems.&nbsp; This feature should be optionally enabled or disabled on a per-wave basis.</span>

<p></a><br style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" /><br />
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Revisions Tracking (aka Playback) Needs Some Work</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Playback/revision tracking needs some work both in its implementation and in its design.&nbsp; Maybe its the developer in me, but a simple revision log with side-by-side diff is more obvious than finding the edits while "playing back".&nbsp; Playback is the only mode that caused the wave ui to "crash" requiring a reload.&nbsp; And was a times slow to respond.</span><br style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" /><br />
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/firefox.png"><img alt="Firefox" height="250" src="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/firefox.png?w=300" width="500" /></a></div>
</h2>
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">A New Dimension to Instant Messaging</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Wave adds new dimensions to instant messaging.&nbsp; No longer do you have to cut and paste part of what someone said to make it clear that you are replying to that bit.&nbsp; You can click on an IM line and reply to that bit - kind of like a threaded discussion forum.&nbsp; The only danger is that the recipient might miss the new message if it is off their screen.&nbsp; Wave UI designers might want to consider a way to keep the conversation linear and still allow replying to past IMs - or perhaps some sort of visual cue to indicate new messages above/below the current visible portion of the screen.</span>
<p />
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/threaded_im_discussion.png"><img alt="Threaded_im_discussion" height="449" src="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/threaded_im_discussion.png?w=300" width="500" /></a></div>
<p />
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Got RAM?</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The web front end is memory intensive taking anywhere from 100M on initial load to 500M on viewing a large wave.</span>
<p />
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mail1.png"><img alt="Mail1" height="41" src="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mail1.png?w=300" width="500" /></a></div>
<p /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">All of these measurements are taken from my Mac Pro running Snow Leopard.&nbsp; Pictured above:&nbsp; "Wave" a Fluid SSB, Waveboard a webkit-based applications, and Firefox with initial weighty overhead of 86M was the least resource intensive.&nbsp; Safari, not shown, shows a similar foot print to the other webkit-based apps.</span>
<p /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">While RAM is cheap, I do enough RAM hungry work in a day to NOT want this bloated Wave app open all the time.</span>
<p />
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Helloooo... Is This Thing On</h2>
<p><a href="http://jduprey.posterous.com/google-wave-theory-vs-reality-2" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">
<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Pastedgraphic-1" height="267" src="http://getfile5.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jduprey/XVpyDkCzDFt39scOBlfuzGtTJFSVyOpdMgBkho8lgbR7E30E6IqGsrokF3am/PastedGraphic-1.png" width="200" /></div>
<p></a><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Perhaps everyone feels the same about the RAM requirements because only once or twice did I ever catch someone on at the same time.&nbsp; Further, because wave accounts are scarce, so is the collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" /><br />
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Google, Build Some Bridges</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Google wave is NOT ubiquitous like e-mail and IM and its current UI is RAM heavy.&nbsp; No one is going to be willing to keep th<br />
e RAM eating wave client open all the time like they do for e-mail, the web, or IM.&nbsp; Google needs to be able to push notifications of wave activity to users via e-mail and IM.&nbsp; Likewise, wave should support sending plain-old-e-mail and IMs from the wave client.&nbsp; With these hooks in place and as the UI gets better, people will spend more an more time in the wave UI.&nbsp; In short, people need a migration path that is less disruptive than switching to a whole new tool and protocol.</span><br style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" /><br />
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Internets, Federate</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">"A Federation is multiple computing and/or network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a collective fashion. ..." --&nbsp;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_%28information_technology%29" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">wikipedia</a>
<p /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Organizations are likely the first to find real value in what wave offers - more so than the end "mom and pop" users who chat with their grandma via IM or shares photos via flickr.&nbsp; Organizations and businesses, are in constant collaboration and as business becomes more and more global more of this collaboration is happening electronically.&nbsp; For the same reasons business host their own e-mail servers, privacy, identity, etc. they will want to host their own wave servers.</span>
<p /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">If the wave client is still in preview, then the federation software is pre-preview.&nbsp; As of this writing, reference/prototype modules exist for the OpenFire XMPP server software.&nbsp; This is all free and open source.&nbsp; A quick glance at the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/wiki/Installation" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">installation instructions</a><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;and it looks pretty straightforward to install.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no wave graphical wave client that will work with it.&nbsp; (Someone correct me if I'm wrong on this point.)&nbsp; All that exists is a simple, limited,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/wiki/ConsoleClient" style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">command line client</a><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">.</span>

<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Hey, Its a Preview!</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Some people love Google to a fault.&nbsp; Some people hate Google because some people love Google to a fault.&nbsp; I love technology.&nbsp; Email, instant messaging, wiki's and other forms of online collaboration and discussion are a part of my daily life.&nbsp; None of them are perfect and some of them are getting long in the tooth, or at the very least being abused.&nbsp; I work in an environment where e-mail and IM is the medium by which almost all collaboration is carried.&nbsp; I welcome a change from the overload of static discussion threads, MS Word attachments etc. &nbsp;</span>
<p /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">While I welcome a re-imagining of e-mail, IM, and wiki's for the 21'st century it isn't clear that Google wave is it.&nbsp; Based on the preview, It has a ways to go but lets not declare it an overhyped flop before it even makes it to beta.&nbsp; I think it shows some promise simply for its use of existing and extended open protocols.&nbsp; Further, if Google can't get the UI right, I'm sure someone else can.</span>
<p /><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">You could be looking at the next big thing since the browser, but a lot of maturing and adoption needs to happen between now and then.</span>
