<p>My daughter has a written a letter for the Easter Bunny. &nbsp;She and I have been searching for the postal mailing address for the Easter Bunny, but amazingly enough the Internets have nothing on it. &nbsp;I thought the USPS might have an address for it, similar to what the do for Santa, but found none.</p>
<p />
<div>Via BoingBoing,&nbsp;<a href="http://boingboing.net/2005/12/13/usps-howto-send-mail.html">http://boingboing.net/2005/12/13/usps-howto-send-mail.html</a>, maybe we could replace "Santa Clause" for Easter Bunny? &nbsp;It doesn't much matter as long as it doesn't get returned to sender - since she is often our mail checker. &nbsp;:)</div>
