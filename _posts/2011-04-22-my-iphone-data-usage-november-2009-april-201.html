<p>I recently took the time to look at my iPhone data usage according to AT&amp;T. This would be data usage on their network and not over WiFi. It seems I've peak at 340 MB. I make an effort to always use trusted WiFi when possible. Its clear from this that the more I travel, the more AT&amp;T data access I use. However, I'm still well below 1 Gig. I could probably save money on a limited plan, but darn it, its nice not to think/worry about usage limits.</p>
