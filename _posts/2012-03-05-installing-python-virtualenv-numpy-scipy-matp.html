<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">To begin, there has been <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/06/21/mac-os-x-lion-clean-install-explained/">some concern</a> that users can't perform a clean install of Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) without quite a bit of <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/07/20/lion-clean-install-guide/">hacking around with physical media</a>. I'm happy to report that isn't true -- as long as you performed a standard Lion install first. The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12">OSX installer</a>&nbsp;(App Store link) automatically creates a "Recovery HD" partition on your hard drive, just in case something goes wrong. The partition contains just two things: Disk Utility &nbsp;and the ability to run the Lion installer. To access this <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718">recovery mode</a>, hold Command-R while your computer is starting up. Use Disk Utility to erase your hard drive, then run the installer to re-download and load Lion. When you're done, you'll have a clean install of Lion. Download your <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">favorite browser</a> and you're good to go. I have to say, discovering this feature was a pleasant surprise -- hats off to Apple for thinking ahead on this one.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't know if I knew this.  Can that recovery HD partition be burned to a CD and booted from there?  Anyone?</p>
