<p>My copy of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife 2005</a> came yesterday.  I quickly installed it to see all the wondrous improvements since the original version of iPhoto/iMovie that came with my power book in 2002.  The motivating factor behind spending the $79.00 for iLife '05 was the updated <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/idvd/">iDVD</a>.  iLife also comes with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a>.
<p />It took over an hour for iLife to import my iPhoto library.  I have 1,756 photos in my library.  However, once the import was complete, I found the new iPhoto to be a lot faster.  I haven't yet played with iPhoto's advanced features, but will take a closer look the next time I import pictures from my digital camera.
<p />iPhoto is only the first stop in my photo archive workflow.  Everything lives in <a href="http://www.iDuprey.com/gallery">my web-based photo-album</a>, <a href="http://gallery.sf.net">powered by Gallery</a>.  I use iPhoto to get pictures from my digital devices and touch them up before importing into Gallery.  I use the <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">iPhotoToGallery</a> export plugin to upload the pictures into Gallery.  (I wish there were some way to sync. gallery with iPhoto.)  I like iPhoto's new keyword feature, but I'm dissappointed it still only supports one library of photos and does not support sub-albums.
<p />iDVD did not install by default because I don't have a super drive.  I have a Lacie DVD writer which Roxio Toast identifies as a "Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-106D."  I believe this is the same model as the super drive.  Even if it isn't, iDVD now supports writing a DVD image which I can then burn using Toast.  The <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10116">CaptyDVD</a> software that came with the Lacie drive is pretty basic.  It will still take nearly 24 hours to encode a DVD using my little 800 MHz powerbook!
<p />I still have 60+ Gig of digital video from <a href="http://www.iduprey.com/gallery/RoyalCaribbeanCruiseWedding">our wedding TWO years ago</a> that needs to be compiled and burned to DVD.  When I get motivated to actually do this, iLife will help.
