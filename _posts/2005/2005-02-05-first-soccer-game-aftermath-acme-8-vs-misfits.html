<div class="entry-content">Well I survived <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jduprey/24365.html">my first soccer game</a> in many years.  Our team won, 8-4, against the "Misfits" and I had a hat trick - 3 goals.  The level of play is pretty low in this league.  In fact, some of the people on the other team had never played soccer before.  I think most of the other teams are a lot better than the "Misfits."
<p />I'm glad we played this team first.  We got a good lead, 5-0, so we never had to work hard to catch up points.  I was concerned that I might not be up to it physically.  This was a good starter game for me.  I was sucking wind the whole time.  I only felt tightness in my chest and I'm pretty sure that was just my lungs trying to get O2.  I've felt a little light headed since Thursday, but that seems to come and go regardless of what I do.
<p />The last indoor soccer league I was on (in NC) was very competitive and rough.  There were a lot of heated (<strong><em>usually</em></strong> verbal) exchanges and the refs seldom made an effort to diffuse the situation.  In this league, there's no checking, sliding, etc.  It should make the games a lot friendlier.  They also have an interesting rule that allows the other team to add an extra player if down by 5 points.
<p />We play Thursday nights at <a href="http://www.totalsports-experience.com/">Total Sports Experience</a>.  Our team is sponsored by <a href="http://www.rochesterdrinks.com/allbars/bar8.html">Acme  Bar &amp; Pizza</a> and the <a href="http://www.totalsports-experience.com/totalexperience/soccer/leagues/winter05adultsoccer/winter05coedthursdays.htm">soccer schedule</a> is <a href="http://www.totalsports-experience.com/totalexperience/soccer/leagues/winter05adultsoccer/winter05coedthursdays.htm">here</a>.</div>
