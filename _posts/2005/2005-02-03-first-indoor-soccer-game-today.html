<p>I'm playing my first indoor soccer match in many many years today.  Since my last indoor soccer league, 4+ years ago, I've discovered that I have <a href="http://www.heartcenteronline.com/myheartdr/common/articles.cfm?ARTID=430">a heart condition</a> and have had a <a href="http://www.iduprey.com/gallery/TheGout">bout</a> with the <a href="http://my.webmd.com/hw/arthritis/hw69013.asp">gout</a>.
<p />No.  I'm not joking.  Both conditions are under control.  My last visit with the cardiologist was encouraging and I got a cautious "OK" to play sports like soccer in moderation.  It took months to get over the gout in my <a href="http://www.iduprey.com/gallery/TheGout">right big toe</a> (on my "kicking foot").  I've never experienced pain like that before.  I've been playing <a href="http://hotshotsvball.com/welcome.cfm">volleyball</a> for over a year now and I *was* going to the gym regularly to play racquet ball and do cardio workouts.  Somehow I fell out of that routine though.  Starting up soccer is not the best way to work back into a cardio routine and I'll have to be careful.  If I push it too hard I could pass out or induce other complications.  It'll also be interesting to see how my toe holds up to constant beating against a soccer ball.
<p />I find it very difficult to go to a gym to lift weights or run in circle, but I <strong><em>love</em></strong> to compete and to play sports.  There are very few things in life that make me feel so alive than when I'm pushing my self physically, or mentally, towards a goal.  Wish me luck!</div>
