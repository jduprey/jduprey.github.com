<div class="entry-content">
<p>September 19'th 2004 marked the day that I officially <a href="http://jduprey.livejournal.com/283.html" title="First LJ Post" target="_blank">started blogging again</a>.&nbsp; For years prior to that I had a <a href="http://phpnuke.org/" title="PHPNuke" target="_blank">PHPNuke</a> and then a&nbsp; <a href="http://news.postnuke.com/Sections-article25-p1.html" title="About Postnuke" target="_blank">Postnuke</a> site that I hosted with my personal computer.&nbsp; I don't really count these because I didn't really use them.&nbsp; They basically satisfied my curiosity in content management (CM) systems. </p>
<p>So I've used LJ for a year and it has been a relatively positive experience.&nbsp; I like LJ's community model and its open development spirit.&nbsp; Many of my friends use LJ and its a great way to keep in touch and share our thoughts.&nbsp; That being said LJ has some serious short comings.&nbsp; It doesn't have easy online searching of your posts.&nbsp; It lacks aesthetics.&nbsp; There are no beautiful styles/themes to choose from.&nbsp; There's a lack of good WYSIYG clients for the Mac or web browser.&nbsp; In fact the only one I'm aware of is <a href="http://deepestsender.mozdev.org/" target="_blank">Deepest Sender</a> and at least for the, Mac, it wasn't stable.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. Breaking the idea that I wanted to get away from maintaining my own blog serving software, I installed WordPress.&nbsp; It has everything that LJ does not have - searching, WYSIWIG editor plugins, beatuiful themes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After years of usage, I know what I want and need in terms of "sharing" on the internet.&nbsp; Photo's.&nbsp; My family takes lots of pictures and we like to share them.&nbsp; If I look at my usage over the past 5 years, I primarily post pictures and sometimes attach a story to the picture.&nbsp; I've used <a href="http://gallery.sf.net" title="Gallery photo software." target="_blank">Gallery</a> to manage my photo's online for years.&nbsp; WordPress has a number of plugins that will allow it to integrate with Gallery.&nbsp; This should make it easier for me to attach those stories to my pictures.</p>
<p>Who doesn't like to have their cake and eat it too?&nbsp; With the WordPress plugin, <a href="http://somuchgeek.com/code/livepress/" title="LivePress plugin" target="_blank">LivePress</a>, I should also be able to cross post to LJ!&nbsp; So far this seems to work.&nbsp; If you are reading this on my LJ then it, indeed has.&nbsp; Well, I guess time will tell if this is *the* solution or yet another tangent.&nbsp; :)</p>
