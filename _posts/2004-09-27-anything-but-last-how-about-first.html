<div class="entry-content">Our volleyball team, "Anything But Last," won the rec. league playoffs.&nbsp; As you can guess by the name, our team has NOT been very good in past seasons.&nbsp; It seems we have started to settle into a real team though.&nbsp; In all fairness, there weren't too many teams this season so we were pretty much guaranteed a shot in the playoffs.&nbsp; The amazing thing is that we beat some of the toughest teams - teams that, in the past, have punished us horribly.&nbsp; We played 3 sets, 7 individual games, over the span of five hours and I'm sore as heck!&nbsp; I may not be able to walk tomorrow!&nbsp; :)
<p />We play at <a href="http://www.hotshotsvball.com/welcome.cfm">Hot Shots</a>.&nbsp; Our name will likely suit us again next season because we are moving up to the intermediate league.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Success hasn't gone to our heads already, we just waited too long to sign up for the rec. league.&nbsp; All the spots were filled.&nbsp; The level of play at the intermediate level will be considerably tougher and I wouldn't be surprised if we *are* last.&nbsp; That's OK though.&nbsp; It'll be a good time to develop skills.
<p />They took our picture.&nbsp; I suspect it'll be posted <a href="http://www.hotshotsvball.com/gallery.cfm">here</a> eventually.&nbsp; (Actually they put the picture in a location that isn't easily linkable.&nbsp; See pic below.)&nbsp; I'll be the guy that looks like he just jumped in the pool.&nbsp; I am a sweaty, disgusting man.&nbsp; I have a volleyball page <a href="http://www.iDuprey.com/vball">here</a>, but it is very much out of date.&nbsp; You may find the links useful though.
