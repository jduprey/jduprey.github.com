<p>There you have it.  IPhones saves lives.  </p>
<p>But I want to know, if he was stuck under the rubble for 65 hours, what did he use the iPhone for the remaining 55 hours after its battery died?  Maybe God really was with him extending the iPhone battery - much like He did with the oil and the lamp - miracle of Hanukah-style. Kidding aside, this is a great story of survival.  Our hearts go out to all those in Haiti.</p>
