<p>I found my old college ID badge at the bottom of some junk today. I was immediately transported back to that time. This thing was printed in the fall of 1991, the day I arrived on campus... nearly twenty years ago.. what?!! Look at that face. So young and innocent. Little did I know that a year from then my Dad would be dead, that I'd be without a safety net struggling with ROTC, keeping the grade, and my own self image. But here, in this picture, I'm still hopeful. I think that is a high school band shirt I'm wearing.. and giant glasses. What a NERD! Twenty years. It might as well be a hundred. That was a lifetime ago and, somehow, things have worked out for me. I thank God for all my blessings.
