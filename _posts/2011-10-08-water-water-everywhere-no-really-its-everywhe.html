<p>???.. Researchers found a lake of water so large that it could provide each person on Earth an entire planet???s worth of water--20,000 times over. .. It's another demonstration that water is pervasive throughout the universe, even at the very earliest times,??? says Matt Bradford, an astrophysicist at NASA???s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and leader of one of the teams that made the discovery. (The journal article reporting the discovery is titled, without drama, ???The Water Vapor Spectrum of APM 08279+5255: X-Ray Heating and Infrared Pumping over Hundreds of Parsecs.???)"</p>
