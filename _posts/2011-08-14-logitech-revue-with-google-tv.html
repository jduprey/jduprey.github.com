<p>The price dropped (temporarily?) to $99 from $299 for the Logitech Revue.   <a href="http://www.maximumtech.com/logitech-hemmorhages-money-slashes-price-googletv-enabled-revue">Sales have been poor</a>, especially after numerous video streaming sites started blocking Google TV.  I believe the box was plagued early on with software glitches as well.  Over the air (OTA) updates have fixed some of these issues - e.g. the Netflix app has improved.  The $99 price point is tempting me to try one out.  I stream netflix a lot and I hate the Tivo netflix integration - very clunky.  I'm also looking for a way to get my other media on the local network to the device.  My first gen. AppleTV is a pain for getting video to my TV - it has a very limited set of video formats it supports.  That said, I'm still searching for what video formats and home media streaming the Revue supports.  I also like the idea of having the web along side the TV - the PIP web browser/video is interesting.  Many times, I've hunted down my laptop or iPhone to look up something related to the show I'm watching...</p>
<p>What are you thoughts on the Revue?  Have one?  Is it worth it give the $99 price point?  Let me know.</p>
