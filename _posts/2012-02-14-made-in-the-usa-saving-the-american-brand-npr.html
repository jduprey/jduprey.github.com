<p>"Today, Kodak is barely a shadow of its former self. Earlier this month, the company that in 1982 once employed more than 60,000 people in Rochester ??? but now has fewer than 7,000 workers there ??? filed for bankruptcy protection." </p>
<p>Its hard to believe with all of Kodak's assets, it couldn't reinvent itself for the digital age.  Its sad to see the icon fade.</p>
