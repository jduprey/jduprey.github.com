<div class="entry-content">My powerbook's hard drive died on Tuesday.  I came home to find my screen saver frozen and could not get remote access via ssh.  I had a number of crashes in the last week which I think was a sign that things were going south - especially since my powerbook (G4 800) is normally stable.  When I reboot the machine appeared to hang.  I rebooted again and this time I pressed <strong>[cmd]-v</strong> before it started to boot.  This took me to verbose/console mode and I was able to watch the system messages.  I noticed a lot of disk I/O errors.

<p />The short of it is the old hard drive broke down - probably a broken write head.?  (It definitely had an interesting rattle to it..)  I got a newer bigger and faster HD out of it at the cost of an OS reinstall and restore (4 evenings of my life, I'll never get back..).  I have a skeleton system running Panther with just the essentials restored - Mail, firefox, iLife, etc.  When Tiger comes I'll get everything restored.
<p />Do you suppose this is fate preventing me from becoming a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">WOW</a> addict like the Van Ee clan?
