<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Bradley Horowitz originally shared this post: Let the Games begin!  We're rolled out!  Many folks have been itching to get the Game's icon on their G+... By now most of you should have it! (Refresh your browsers) Should be an exciting weekend!  Be advised, that like any feature during Field Trial, we may need to rollback as we monitor system load and learn... but I hope you enjoy the experience and share your feedback.  <a href="http://plus.google.com/games">http://plus.google.com/games</a></p></blockquote>
