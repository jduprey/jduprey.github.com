<div class="entry-content">Inspite of my miserable cold today <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">was</span> filled with friends, family,&nbsp; good food, and LOVE.&nbsp; Abby did most of the work because I was quite incapacitated with this cold.&nbsp; (I appear to have some sort of double-whammy sinus and digestive illness going on..it hurts.)&nbsp; As per tradition, Abby's parents came over for presents and dinner.
<p />Emma was a joy to watch her discover how her new toys worked.&nbsp; She said a quite a few new words (sorta) like doggy.&nbsp; Between last night's party and today, she now has plenty of new toys - too many probably.&nbsp; Her favorite so far appears to be a block sorter.&nbsp; If you are one of the many who gave Emma a present, thank you!&nbsp; She also receive many cute new outfits.&nbsp; Watch for pictures of her modelling them.
<p />I was apparently a very good boy this year.&nbsp; I received many nice presents myself - including a green iPod Mini and a very nice leather jacket.&nbsp; (Finally, I own an iPod!&nbsp; Hurray!&nbsp; I may blog about why I asked for a mini another day.)&nbsp; Abby's father gave me a nice hydraulic jack.&nbsp; Maybe I'll stop pestering him for his when I need to change my tires.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Abby received some kitchen things she asked for along with some PS1 video games and a DVD.
<p />We ended the day with bread pudding and a movie - all except Abby who slept soundly by the tree on the dog's new oversized bed.&nbsp; Its days like these that you want to burn in your mind forever.&nbsp; We were happy and together.&nbsp; I give thanks to God for my family and our little miracle - Emma.
<p />Merry Christmas!
