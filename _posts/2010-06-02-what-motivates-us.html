<p>Some of my colleagues linked to these&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/about-us">RSA</a>&nbsp;videos recently via&nbsp;<a href="http://yammer.com">yammer</a>.
<p />
<div>The first video, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&amp;playnext_from=TL&amp;videos=BZfX-EeLkQM">Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us</a>", rang true with me. &nbsp;In the presentation they talked about how independent studies (Carnegie Mellon and MIT) &nbsp;have shown that, after a point, monetary reward does not make people more productive in jobs that require cognitive skill. &nbsp;In fact, higher monetary rewards produced worse performance. &nbsp;It seems the best motivator is to pay people enough so the issue of money is "off the table." &nbsp;This lets people think about the work. &nbsp;Once money is out of the way there are three factors that lead to better performance: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Amen! &nbsp;Watch the video:</div>

<div>The second video, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5um8QWWRvo">Smile or Die</a>," talks about realistic thinking and how a serious lack of it has been doing a lot of damage. &nbsp;This video is just good for everyone to watch and maybe reflect on their attitudes. &nbsp;Hopelessly optimistic is just as bad pessimistic. &nbsp;Somewhere in between is something that approximates the truth and from that a measured response.</div>
