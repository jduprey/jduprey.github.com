<p>Mint.com has been a financial life saver for me.  I can finally track where all my money goes and set a budget that I can follow!  However, since its been acquired by Intuit, quality of service has been a little erratic.  For example, a week went by before they resolved a problem with sync'ing with my bank.  Its hard to fault a free service like this, but there are some things even a free service should not fail on - security.  For Facebook issue, it just looks like Mint's third party promotional partner did not follow protocol with Facebook.  I spent last evening changing all my account passwords for fear of a real phishing attack had occured.  Regardless, Mint *should* be all over this doing damage control.  BTW, Mint, get your act together and charge me for a "Pro account."  I'll pay!</p>
