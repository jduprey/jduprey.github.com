<p>Today was the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uwrochester.org/">Rochester New York&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.uwrochester.org/">United Way</a>'s "<a href="http://www.uwrochester.org/day-of-caring.aspx">Day of Caring</a>". &nbsp;From their web site, "<em>Each year, thousands of people from area businesses, schools and community groups lend their time, talents, and energy to volunteer projects that make a difference in our community.</em>"</p>
<p>This year I participated with a number of my team members at Thomson Reuters. &nbsp;We helped the Genesee Land Trust in its development of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589946011">El Camino Trail</a>. &nbsp;According to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589946011">City of Rochester</a>, "<em>The El Camino: Butterhole/Seneca Park Trail is adapting an old railroad line to become a multi-use pedestrian greenway. When completed, the 2.25-mile trail&nbsp;will run from Mill Street in High Falls all the way to the&nbsp;Seneca Park&nbsp;pedestrian bridge.&nbsp;The Trail will provide a safe,&nbsp;continuous pedestrian and bicycle route accessible to citizens from all walks of life, that links key destinations in&nbsp;the city.</em>"</p>
<p>The part of the trail we worked on was north of the intersection of Norton Street and Hollenbeck Street. &nbsp;About 60 volunteers joined in the effort coming from local businesses such as&nbsp;Bausch&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lomb and Unity Health System. &nbsp;You couldn't have asked for better weather. &nbsp;It was sunny and warm. &nbsp;We cleared brush and picked up trash along the trail. &nbsp;It was fun to work side by side with my co-workers in a completely different setting and a great day to be&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AFK">AFK</a>.</p>
