<p>iDuprey.com enjoyed another hiatus from the internet on Saturday due to a power outage.&nbsp; A very large tree decided to rest on our power lines in the back yard.&nbsp; It took them all day to remove the tree and turn the power back on.&nbsp; We fired up the generator to keep us warm, but the site did not rank so high to deserve electricity too.&nbsp; Power was lost around 11 AM on Saturday and returned around 11 PM.&nbsp; Lets hope we have no more interruptions for a while.&nbsp; The power crew ripped the cable line off our house and left it lying on the ground.&nbsp; Fortunately, this did not impact our cable or internet service.&nbsp; We will be filing a complaint with RG&amp;E later this week.

<p>I'll post some interesting pictures of the tree later. </p>
