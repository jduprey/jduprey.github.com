<p>FWIW, while Fester [Steve Balmer] keeps going around telling people that &ldquo;96 out of 100 times, people choose Windows,&rdquo; his own people know (and will admit) that in the U.S. we&rsquo;ve got about 10 percent, and since almost zero of that comes from enterprise, this means that in the U.S. consumer space we&rsquo;ve got about 20 percent. </p>
<p>Now think about that. We&rsquo;re one company, with five notebook models and about that many desktops (depending on how you count them). We&rsquo;re up against all of the other PC makers in the world &mdash; that&rsquo;s dozens of companies, with hundreds of models &mdash; and the world&rsquo;s largest software company. </p>
<p>And yet, in the U.S. consumer space, we sell one out of every five machines.</p>

<p>Apple continues to do well as Fake Steve points out and CNET backs up (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10409462-37.html)">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10409462-37.html)</a>.  They just squeezed some money out of me for a new laptop - 13 inch MacBook Pro.  From what I can tell, its a good looking, sturdy, and fast machine that should serve me as well as my last Apple laptop - a six year old Powerbook G4 800MHz.</p>
