<div><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="font-size:24px;">Stargate Universe Premier on SyFy</span></span></div>
<p /><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:13px;"><a href="http://www.syfy.com/universe/">Stargate Universe (SGU)</a>&nbsp;premiered on&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">SyFy</span>&nbsp;SciFi&nbsp;Friday night. &nbsp;Unlike SG Atlantis, this promises to be a darker more serious SG if the two hour premier is any indication. &nbsp;The acting was top notch, especially compared to Atlantis.&nbsp;</span>

<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Cast_01" height="320" src="http://getfile1.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jduprey/eQBC2DwAd4bzuAlsJBPD0ODtj1M7ZrcbHO1HTBqbkU3qStD222R9zg86ujwK/cast_01.jpg" width="214" /></div>

<p />
<div><span style="font-size:13px;">Actor&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001015/">Robert Carlyle</a>&nbsp;plays the lead scientist Dr. Nicholas Rush. &nbsp;Rush seems disaffected and obsessed with walking through the gate using the ninth "chevron" address. &nbsp;Under extraordinary circumstances he dials it and he and about 80 other people are forced to escape through it. &nbsp;They find themselves stranded on a ship traveling faster than light and thousands of&nbsp;<b><i>galaxies</i></b>&nbsp;away. &nbsp;Of course they managed to bring along some ancient technology that allows them to "phone home." &nbsp;Lame. &nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size:13px;">Rush seems to have a vision or a plan for his warp across the universe and its saneness is questionable a best. &nbsp;I can't help but think that I've seen Carlyle play the same type character in another movie. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it was in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463854/">28 Weeks Later</a>&nbsp;in which his character abandons his wife, whom he loves.. but not that much, to the ravages of the rage virus - zombie-like plague. &nbsp;(28 Weeks Later is an excellent modern zombie flick. &nbsp;I recommend it.)</span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size:13px;">Universe isn't all doom and gloom, the other chief nerd who rival Rush's intelligence brings some comic relief. &nbsp;I foresee him, playing very much the role of Atlantis'&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005972/">Dr. Rodney McKay</a>&nbsp;- one of Atlantis' more real, and endearing characters.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size:13px;">Here's to hoping the rest of the series maintains the level of quality and balance between SciFi, drama, and humor as seen in the premier.</span></div>
