<div class="entry-content">Here's a conversation I recently had with one of my neighbors - a woman in her late forties / early fifties.
<p />
<hr /><strong><em>neighbor</em></strong>: (<em>Slightly agitated and partially concealed by her front door..</em>) "<strong>I know you pick up after your dog, but I don't want him on my lawn AT ALL.</strong>"
<p /><strong><em>me</em></strong>: (<em>Without sarcasm.</em>)  "<strong>OK.  We'll do our best.</strong>"  (Glancing down at her lawn I notice it is mostly dandelions and something else that looks like another pretty weed...)
<p /><strong><em>neighbor</em></strong>: (<em>On the verge of lunacy, she quickly opens her door wider and takes one step out..</em>) "<strong>No!  You'll do exactly as I say!</strong> [something..something...something]"
<p /><strong><em>me</em></strong>: (<em>Using all my mental powers of self control and without sarcasm and only the slightest inflection on the word "nice."</em>) "<strong>Have a nice day.</strong>"  (<em>Mason (the dog) and I quickly walk away.. Mason is still bouncing around wanting to play with the crazy lady...</em>)
<p /><strong><em>neighbor</em></strong>: (<em>With my mental powers exhausted, I didn't exactly hear her parting remarks.. something to the effect: "<strong>Good day to you TOO SIR!</strong>"</em>)
<p />
<hr />That kind of sh*t really f**ks my sh*t right up for the rest of the day.  Many days later, I've let the incident go and "Will do my best" to keep my dog off her lawn.  Still, I wonder what makes a person behave like that?  Is she:
<ol></ol>
<p>
<li>On the verge of a nervous breakdown?</li>
<li>Feeling so helplessly out of control that she desperately needs to feel like she is in control of SOMETHING?</li>
<li>Off her meds?</li>
<li>On someone else's meds?</li>
<li>Satan?</li>
<p />This brings me to the topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma">Karma</a> or more/less precisely, "What goes around, comes around."  I'm glad I stayed relatively quiet and did not exchange barbs with this woman.  Life is too short, and Karmic, to allow myself to be mired in petty disputes.  I only wish my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego%2C_Superego_and_Id">superego</a> could nudge my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego%2C_Superego_and_Id">ego</a> like this a little more often.
