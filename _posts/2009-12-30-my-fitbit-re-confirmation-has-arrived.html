<div>I started this fitness kick last year, January 1, as a new year's resolution - "Lose the weight, re-claim your youth, delay the inevitable cardiac death that awaits me." &nbsp;I lost nearly 30 pounds through diet and exercise. &nbsp;I feel healthier, and more energetic. &nbsp;It seems its all about inertia. &nbsp;A body at rest tends to stay at rest, a body in motion... So the fitness thing kinda feeds into itself perpetuating more fitness. &nbsp;The <a href="http://fitbit.com">FitBit</a> seemed like a good motivator to keep the fitness momentum going. &nbsp;It supposedly tracks your steps taken with a good degree of accuracy and automagically uploads it to their web site. &nbsp;Keeping active, staying in motion, is the goal and you can set the number of steps you want to take each day. &nbsp;It isn't the first "biometric-type" device I've used. &nbsp;My first was the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-00679-25-Forerunner-50-Monitor/dp/B000UVZ5TA">Garmin Forerunner 50</a>&nbsp;which has a foot pod (step/run counter) and heart rate monitor, among other devices. &nbsp;This device also seamlessly uploads my workouts to a web site and gives me pretty graphs to track my progress. While the Forerunner is meant to workouts. &nbsp;The FitBit is meant for use the entire day, tracking how sedentary or active you are.</div>
<p />
<div>I pre-ordered my&nbsp;<a href="http://fitbit.com">FitBit</a>&nbsp;way back in May 2009. &nbsp;It was supposed to ship early summer. &nbsp;After MANY delays, the device is finally ready and I must re-confirm that I still want the thing. &nbsp;It is with some hesitance that I confirm my order, but I'm still intrigued by the device even if the company's numerous delays and less than shining web site (<a href="http://fitbit.com">http://fitbit.com</a>) has shaken my confidence. &nbsp;I suppose all will be forgiven if the device works as well as they claim. &nbsp;Delaying the product to ensure the best, and most accurate, step counting etc. is admirable. &nbsp;But if it is still a shiny black turd, then I have no one to blame but myself. &nbsp;The writing was on the wall. &nbsp;</div>
