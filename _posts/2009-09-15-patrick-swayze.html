<p>Sadly, Patrick Swayze passed away today. &nbsp;I enjoyed his films. &nbsp;Most remember him for "Ghost" or "Dirty Dancing", but I choose to remember him in "Red Dawn," "Road House," and "Point Break." &nbsp;The cry "Wolverines!!!" still echoes in the depths of my teenage memories.
<p />
<div>The ultimate in bad-assery was when Swayze's character literally tiger-claw's this bad guys throat out in "Road House." &nbsp;I assure you, the bad guy really had it coming. &nbsp;The closest image I could find was from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/10/28/arts/television/SWAYZE_SS_20081029_5.html">this NY times page</a>.</div>
