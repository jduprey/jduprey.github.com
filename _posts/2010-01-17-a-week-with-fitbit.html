<p />After&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.iduprey.com/my-fitbit-re-confirmation-has-arrived">some hesitation</a>, I reconfirmed my&nbsp;<a href="http://fitbit.com">Fitbit</a>&nbsp;order the end of December. &nbsp;Fitbit is a high-tech step counter. &nbsp;It utilizes wireless&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_(network)">Ant</a>+ technology to sync its data to your desktop where it is automatically uploaded to the free Fitbit web site,&nbsp;<a href="http://fitbit.com">fitbit.com</a>. &nbsp;This small black device clips to your clothing or the included wristband for sleeping. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Sleeping. &nbsp;The device has a record function that allows you place start and stop markers in your step data that delineate specific activities - sleep being one special activity. &nbsp;The Fitbit site is able to show how restful your sleep was based on how much you moved around during the night. &nbsp;The device has a single button that allows you to toggle through all information on its clever&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oled">OLED</a>&nbsp;display. &nbsp;I say clever, because when the display is not active it is invisible - its just a black surface. &nbsp;That single button is also used to mark activities, by holding it down for two seconds.

<div>Basically, this little thing is meant to be with you most of the time - monitoring your activity or lack of thereof. &nbsp;The free web site allows you to track your activity stats, manually enter other activities, track your weight and record the food/calories you've consumed during the day. &nbsp;After a week of use, I can say it works as advertised.. for me. &nbsp;Here is a screenshot of my dashboard on fitbit.com:</div>
<p />

<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/fitbit_dashboard1-png-scaled-1000.jpg"><img alt="Fitbit_dashboard1" height="871" src="http://jduprey.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/fitbit_dashboard1-png-scaled-1000.jpg?w=172" width="500" /></a></div>
</div>
<p />
<div>The site is very clean and easy to use. &nbsp;I particularly like the food tracking UI. &nbsp;It is missing some of the goal setting features of other sites. &nbsp;But the biggest missing feature in my opinion is a comprehensive database of exercises and the ability to set activity stats like heart rate, calories burned, etc. &nbsp;Because of this and the limited goal setting options, I cannot recommend it to the hard core fitness junky or those seriously looking to lose weight. &nbsp;For those people, I still have to point them to&nbsp;<a href="http://dailyburn.com">http://dailyburn.com</a>&nbsp;(paid) or&nbsp;<a href="http://thedailyplate.com">http://thedailyplate.com</a>. &nbsp;The Dailyburn helped me lose 30 lbs last year! &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>From the community forums and my own experiences it is clear that kinks are still being worked out in the device and the web site. &nbsp;None of these kinks have been show stoppers for me. &nbsp;The biggest issue I had was with the Mac driver software - it interferes with my Garmin Ant stick I use to sync my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner50/">Forerunner 50</a>&nbsp;data. &nbsp;Neither device would work while both were plugged in. &nbsp;I now sync my Garmin device using my laptop and have left the Fitbit base on my desktop computer. &nbsp;In the forums, others have reported Mac kernel panics and other stability issues. &nbsp;I've had none of that running Snow Leopard. &nbsp;The device itself seems pretty stable. &nbsp;Occasionally it will stop updating its step count on the screen, but if I cycle the activity mode on it, it seems to start updating the display again. &nbsp;Others in the forums have reported that it totally freezes on them forcing them to hit the reset button. &nbsp;I have not experienced that problem either. &nbsp;Firmware updates are supposedly in the works. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I see a lot of potential in what the Fitbit is doing. &nbsp;Becoming more aware my level of activity and caloric intake was the key to my losing weight. &nbsp;Devices that made it painless and quick to do were essential. &nbsp;Maybe its the geek in me, but watching my progress through a series of charts and meters definitely was motivational. &nbsp;I'm hesitant to recommend Fitbit to everyone looking to lose weight. &nbsp;There seem to be too many little bugs and missing features in the web site to make it a complete solution. &nbsp;However, for the early adopter with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/product">$99 to burn</a>, its a lot of fun. &nbsp;Get it here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/product">http://www.fitbit.com/product</a>&nbsp;</div>
