<p>Apple CEO Steve Jobs To Step Down<br />by NPR Staff and Wires
<p> - August 24, 2011</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, the mind behind the iPhone, iPad and other devices that turned Apple Inc. into one of the world's most powerful companies, resigned as the company's CEO Wednesday, saying he can no longer handle the job.</p>
<p>The move appears to be the result of an unspecified medical condition for which he took an indefinite leave from his post in January. Apple's chief operating officer, Tim Cook, has been named CEO.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to Apple's board and the "Apple community," Jobs said he "always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come."</p>
<p>Apple said Jobs was elected board chairman and Cook is becoming a member of its board.</p>
<p>The company said Jobs gave the board his resignation Wednesday and suggested Cook be named the company's new leader.</p>
<p>The January leave was Jobs' third medical leave over several years. He had previously survived pancreatic cancer and received a liver transplant.</p>
<p>"This is an indication that he's not in good health and he can't be as involved in the day-to-day running of the operation," NPR's Laura Sydell told Melissa Block, host of All Things Considered. [Copyright 2011 National Public Radio]</p>
