<p>Secretary Hilary Clinton gives a very compelling speech on the advocacy for equal rights of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.  Its a 30 minute video and I feel she supports her arguments well.  For me, she was preaching to the choir, but I hope her statesmanship is able to change the hearts and minds of others in power.  And for those of you who do not share the view that the LGBT community should be afforded the same rights and freedoms as everyone else, please set aside your opinions for a moment and hear her argument.</p>
