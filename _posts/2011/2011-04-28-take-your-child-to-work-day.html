<p>Today was "Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work" day. &nbsp;Emma was very excited to go and surprisingly insisted on staying the whole day with me. &nbsp;I put her to work learning about career choices and later she "interviewed" me using a set of interview questions provided by the daughtersandsonstowork.org web site. &nbsp;She participated in our morning "scrum" where each team member talks about what they did yesterday and what they plan to do today. &nbsp;Later on, I tried to show her how much of my job is spent communicating - via meetings, e-mail, instant messaging, phone, <a href="http://yammer.com">yammer</a> ("facebook for work" as I described it to her), etc. &nbsp;We then looked at how design documents describe in human terms what the software is *supposed* to do, and then we looked at some software we were working on that "made web pages for searching for stuff" ("you know, like google"). &nbsp;That nearly put her to sleep. :)</p>
<p>Emma was well behaved and kept herself busy with other activies so Dad could get *some* work done.</p>

<p>We rushed home to eat dinner. &nbsp;Went to T-Ball practice. &nbsp;Rushed home and wrote up a story based on her interview notes. &nbsp;I helped in this effort. &nbsp;After helping her organize her thoughts, she dictacted the story as I typed and I think it largely captures what she learned today. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this was a great experience for her and she is already asking when she can come do it again. &nbsp;I told her, next year. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I really enjoyed sharing with Emma what I do. &nbsp;I like what I do and am proud of my accomplishments. &nbsp;It was great to share with Emma what I do when I'm not at home with her. &nbsp;I also hope to spark an interest in math, and "the sciences". &nbsp;Those fields could really use more female representation and its really not a bad way to make a living. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Logistically speaking, it isn't easy for a company to have everyone bring in their kids on the same day. &nbsp;A number of people around the office commented that they thought our site had terminated the practice. &nbsp;I don't know what the official policy is at our Rochester site, but I did clear it with my boss before hand. &nbsp;We do allow for a fair amount of disruption for other educational and charitable activities. &nbsp; It would seem that this event could be formatted to minimize disruption in our workplace.</p>
