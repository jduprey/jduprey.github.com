<p>Funny.  Google+ might be like Facebook, but better?  Only time will tell.  I hate facebook.  Its a messy place with a poor track record on privacy.  Privacy is hard to get right.  Google had similar issues with Buzz.  Lets see if they get plus right.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: 7/29/2011 Google Plus is gaining momentum and I would recommend you go try it out now..</p>
