<div class="quoteText">"Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life.  So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically.  That&rsquo;s kinda cool!  That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that.  It&rsquo;s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe.  We are in the universe and the universe is in us."      <br /> &mdash;        <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12855.Neil_deGrasse_Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a></div>

<p>I like Neil deGrasse Tyson.  He makes&nbsp;impenetrable&nbsp;subjects such as astrophysics accessible.  What Neil describes above is more than "cool" it is incredibly elegant, beautiful even.</p>
