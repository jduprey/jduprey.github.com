<p>The following is a very prompt and concise reply from the&nbsp;<a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a>&nbsp;support team in regards to Google+ autoposting from Posterous.
<p />
<div>
<div>Begin forwarded message:</div>
<p><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><br />
<blockquote><span style="font-family:Helvetica Neue, HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;line-height:16px;">Thank-you for your feedback. When Google + comes out of beta and develops an API, we will begin to consider it as an autoposting destination.</span></p></blockquote>
<p />
<div>BTW. &nbsp;If you haven't considered Posterous for your blogging or community news letter needs, you should really check it out. &nbsp;Getting content to the web was never so easy!</div>
