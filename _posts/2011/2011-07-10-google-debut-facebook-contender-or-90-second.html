<div><a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+</a>&nbsp;is Googe's version of&nbsp;<a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and I'm in. &nbsp;I really like the clean interface, the lack of obnoxious advertisements, and its "circle" privacy management. &nbsp;A social service only works though if all the people you care about uses it. &nbsp;It is the *only* reason I bothered with Facebook - even my elderly and technophobic in-laws were using it. &nbsp;So what will lure people from Facebook to Google+? &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>First, time wasters. &nbsp;I think they'll have to add those stupid games that people play on Facebook. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Second, integration with other services - including Facebook. &nbsp;At least for the short term, the ability to cross post status to facebook will be important. &nbsp;Services like&nbsp;<a href="http://posters.com">Posterous</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://ping.fm/">Ping</a>&nbsp;will need to add a Google+ option too.</div>
<p />
<div>Like Google&nbsp;<a href="http://wave.google.com">Wave</a>&nbsp;before it, I'm rooting for Google+. &nbsp;While less ambitious than&nbsp;Wave&nbsp;in terms of innovation and totally changing how we communicate,&nbsp;Google+ is trying to take on &nbsp;THE social network site, Facebook, with its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">750 million active users</a>. &nbsp;If nothing else, maybe this competition will force Facebook to fix some of its problems with privacy. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>One thing is for sure, this new entry in the social space is going to confuse my in-laws when they get their invitation from me. &nbsp;:)</div>
