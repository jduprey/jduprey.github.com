<p>Finally started trying out Google Music Beta... I wonder how long it will take for my music to upload?&nbsp; There is no iPhone/iPod app yet and there doesn't seem to be an iOS optimized web site yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: A Couple of days have passed and I already have ~1500 songs uploaded out of the 5500+ songs I have currently in my library. &nbsp;At this pace, my entire library could be backed up in the cloud in under a week. &nbsp;A screenshot of the web interface has been added to the photo gallery.</p>
