<div><a href="http://www.republicwireless.com/">Republic&nbsp;Wireless</a>'&nbsp;"beta" voice and data offering costs $19/month with no contract! &nbsp;It manages such a low price point by using wi-fi for voice and data whenever possible. &nbsp;It is in beta and so it can take a while to become a "member". &nbsp;What are the catches?</div>
<p />
<div>1. It only works with one phone -&nbsp;<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/lg-optimus-s-charcoal/4505-6452_7-34192073.html?tag=mncol;subnav">LG Optimus</a></div>
<div>2. If you use the cell network "too much", they will eventually boot you.</div>
<div>3. Its BETA - meaning the switching from wi-fi to cell network might not work so great, you might experience poor call quality over wi-fi, or have dropped calls.</div>
