<p>Amazon's latest Kindle eReaders are more than competitively priced and are bound to sell millions(?) of these devices.  They have to be selling these devices almost at a loss or break even, but will make it back in Amazon purchases through this device.  I think many people will find one (or two) of these under their Christmas tree this year.</p>
