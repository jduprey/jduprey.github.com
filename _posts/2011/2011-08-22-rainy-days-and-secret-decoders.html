<p> My daughter likes to play post office.&nbsp; She likes to exchange letters with me using a toy mailbox.&nbsp; Its a great way for her to practice her hand writing.. and she doesn't even know it.&nbsp; She and I built a new mailbox to exchange messages today.&nbsp; Sometimes she likes to encode her messages using an en/decoder card she got somewhere along the line.&nbsp; It being a terribly gray and rainy day, we decided to write a program to encode/decode messages.&nbsp; <span>I had already taught her to play tic-tac-toe using row-column coordinates.&nbsp; We computer geeks know that row/column structure to be a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29">matrix</a>" in computer science terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also given her a lesson or two on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a> - an educational programming language.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>(<span style="font-style:italic;">Please understand that she had been asking me to teach her to program - "like what you do at work, Daddy."&nbsp; I'm not, necessarily, trying build a super-nerd so that I can live vicariously through her nerdy accomplishments.. although worse things could happen to a person. :</span>) <span></span>&nbsp; </span>Anyway...
<p />  This de/encoder simply shifts letters by one, but to make a fully working program there was quite a bit for a 6 year old to take in.&nbsp; I threw a lot at her and with no introduction - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28computer_science%29">functions</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash maps</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29">variables</a>.&nbsp; Forget the UI/HTML glue needed to drive it!&nbsp; Needless to say, most of it went over her head but conceptually, she understood that we were taking each letter and doing a lookup to return its encoded/decoded form.&nbsp; She helped type in the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">cipher</a>" which was just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">map</a> from letter to encoded letter.
<p />  Regardless of what she <span style="font-style:italic;">may</span> have learned, she loved the end result and has already requested a "print encoded message feature."&nbsp; (Only then did it feel like a program <span>" </span>at work". :)&nbsp; We'll revisit this one agains sometime soon..<br />

<p />  The end result is a simple web app - nothing more than some HTML and some Javascript.&nbsp; You can view/run it here:<br /> <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261443/www/SecretDecoder/decoder.html">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261443/www/SecretDecoder/decoder.html</a>
