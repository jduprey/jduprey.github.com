<p>Hello Friends,
<p />My daughter's school is having a basket raffle with some pretty sweet baskets - containing ipads, xboxes, etc. Raffle tickets are a dollar ($1) or 6 tickets for five dollars ($5). All proceeds go to Emma's school, Christ the King. Do it for the children or your own greed! ;) Basket details are below...
<p /> Let me know if you are interested and which baskets you want to put your ticket(s) towards. Abby or I will stop by to collect.
<p /> Here is a picture of my child:</p>

<p>How could you say no to that face?
<p /> Here are all the cool baskets up for raffle:</p>
