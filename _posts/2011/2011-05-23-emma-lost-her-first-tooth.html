<p>Emma lost her first tooth tonight, right before bed. It had been wiggling for weeks. The last few nights I checked it to see if it was ready.. finally, tonight more than perpendicular to her gum, I tested it again and it popped out with little effort. Emma was crazy excited about the prospects of the Tooth Fairy paying her a visit. I told her I heard that freckles come from fairy foot prints. She quickly, and very much on her own, decided we should compare these pictures to one in the morning to see if it is true. Do you think she will have more freckles come morning time?</p>

<p>On a more serious note, we've put off the regular dentist visit, but given the plaque build up on her little lost tooth, I think its time for a cleaning and perhaps time to consider flossing regularly...</p>
