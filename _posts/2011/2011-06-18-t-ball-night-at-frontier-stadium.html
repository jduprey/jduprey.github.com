<p>It was a kid's baseball night at Frontier stadium. The kids got to do a lap around the baseball field. We stayed for the fireworks which meant a really late night for M. It was after 11PM by the time we got home. She had a lot of fun playing around with her friends and eating junk food. As I carried her on my shoulders out of the stadium, she declared I was the best Dad ever. :)</p>
