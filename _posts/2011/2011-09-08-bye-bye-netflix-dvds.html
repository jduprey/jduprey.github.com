<div>There. &nbsp;Its done. &nbsp;I've dropped my Netflix DVD/Bluray plan due to the&nbsp;<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20078960-93/dear-netflix-price-hike-ignites-social-media-fire/">price hike</a>. &nbsp;I'm now streaming only, which is pretty much the bulk of how I used the service anyway. &nbsp;But when they&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/02/us-netflix-starz-idUSTRE78063S20110902">lose Starz next year</a>, I'll have to reconsider if the unlimited streaming at 8/month is worth it.</div>
<p />
<div>I guess I'll have to drag my butt to a Redbox if I want to watch a new release or spend $4/rental from iTunes or Amazon VOD.</div>
<p />
<div>But its hard to blame Netflix for these problems. &nbsp;The movie and television industry do not want content consumed this way. &nbsp;We are spending way too much for media from our cable company, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/21/television-networks-block-google-tv-from-accessing-web-based-con/">at this rate</a>, we'll never be able to "<a href="http://gigaom.com/video/5-steps-to-cutting-the-cord-a-guide-to-canceling-cable/">cut the cord</a>."
