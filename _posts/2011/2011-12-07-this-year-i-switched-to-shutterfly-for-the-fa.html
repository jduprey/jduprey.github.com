<div>This year I switched to&nbsp;<a href="http://shutterfly.com">Shutterfly</a>&nbsp;for the family photo calendar. &nbsp;For the past several years, I have used iPhoto and Apple's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/print-products.html">print services</a>. &nbsp;This summer I switched to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/picasa">Picasa</a>. &nbsp;Rather than bring all my calendar photos back into iPhoto, I chose to use one of the many available Internet printing services out there. &nbsp;Picasa allows for direct upload to many of these sites. &nbsp;I studied&nbsp;<a href="http://snapfish.com">Snapfish</a>&nbsp;and Shutterfly closely and it seemed that Shutterfly was slightly cheaper. &nbsp;There shipping seemed more expensive, but a couple of coupon codes negated that.</div>
<p />
<div><a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/print-products.html#in-year-pictures">Apple's 13x10 calendars cost $19.99/calendar</a>&nbsp;with ~$6 shipping. &nbsp;Shutterfly's 8.5x11 cost $13.68 and ~$8 shipping. &nbsp;To be fair, Shutterfly's calendar *is* a bit smaller and the price is after a promotional 40% discount, good only up to today. &nbsp;However, in addition to that we had a $10 off coupon and a 50% off shipping coupon. &nbsp;In the end it was cheaper, but only because of the sale. &nbsp;I would recommend shopping around before you commit to an order.</div>
<p />
<div>The web-based interface worked fine. &nbsp;Of course you can't compare it to iPhoto's native application interface. &nbsp;iPhoto is far superior in that department. &nbsp;Still it was good enough. &nbsp;Shutterfly's print and paper quality won't be known until it arrives.</div>
