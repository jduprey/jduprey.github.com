<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Health is diverse and multi-faceted. As I discussed last week, there isn???t one<a href="http://www.livestrong.com/blog/blog/the-big-health-controversy/"> standardized lifestyle approach</a>. And that shouldn???t be a frustrating experience. Yes???there???s a lot of health information and much of it is bad or confusing. But here???s a truth that isn???t shared enough: Living healthy doesn???t have to be constraining, uncomfortable, and even painful. &nbsp;I know plenty of people who look great but hate the way they live. And many others that hate the way they look and love the way they live. Being fit is finding the middle ground where you look the way you want, enjoy the way you live, and still remain healthy. To find that holy grail you need to ask yourself, what do <em>you</em> want?&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
