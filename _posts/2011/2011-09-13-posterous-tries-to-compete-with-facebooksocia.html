<div>Interesting.. I love Posterous for blogging, but they need to do more for managing my media (photo's at least) before they can compete with flickr and facebook for sharing. &nbsp;Right now with Posterous, its really easy to upload photos.. but thats it. &nbsp;No captioning. &nbsp; Sharing photos across blogs posts isn't exactly convenient, etc.</div>
<p />
<div>.. and it seems that Posterous is pronounced paw-ster-us - like preposterous - not post-er-ous - like I "post" to my blog.</div>
