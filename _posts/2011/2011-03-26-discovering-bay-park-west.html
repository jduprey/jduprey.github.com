<p>Abby discovered a near by entrance to bay park west. It should afford me a "big loop" should I ever get running again. <br /><a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/jduprey/activity/29060072">http://runkeeper.com/user/jduprey/activity/29060072</a> <br />From the map, you can see S. Glenn Rd is not too far and the trails do hook up with it.
