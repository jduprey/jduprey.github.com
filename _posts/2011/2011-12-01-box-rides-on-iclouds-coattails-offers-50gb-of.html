No, your eyes don't deceive you -- Box is offering 50GBs of <em>free</em> storage inside its cloud for iOS users -- just like it did for <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/29/hp-touchpad-review/">TouchPad</a> owners back in June. Anyone who downloads the latest version of Box's app for iPad and iPhone will receive their massive lot for data storage after registering a personal account (existing accounts can join in on the fun as well). To make better use of that extra space, Box will also be bumping upload capacity from 25MB to 100MB per file and baking in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/airplay/">AirPlay</a> support. Look, Box is obviously skitching on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/icloud/">iCloud's</a> tail, but it sure seems like a crazy good deal considering that space is yours "forever." The promotion will last for 50 days, officially starting at 12AM on October 14th -- although, we're already seeing the update on our end. Full details in the source link.</div>

<p>I got mine!  I'm a dropbox user, but for 50GB of free storage for life, I'll get my foot in the door - hedge my bets.  :)</p>
