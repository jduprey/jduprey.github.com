<div>Fake Steve Jobs isn't what he used to be, too bitter and mean these days, but this diatribe on America missing the next big industry, energy, is dead on. America has fallen under it's own weight and can't get up. &nbsp; The following article is from the Fake Steve Jobs blog:<br />

<p>The folks who made this video maybe didn't realize that it shows us just how totally screwed we are. Or maybe they did. Warning: if you only come to this blog to read about Apple, you can skip this item.
<p />Listen, energy isn't my field of expertise. And it's not what this blog is about. On the other hand, I am a citizen, and I'm #2 on this year's Vanity Fair <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2009/10/new-establishment200910" target="_blank">New Establishment</a> list, and I also happen to be very close friends with Al Gore. But if you only come here to read about Apple, just move on.
<p />So here's the thing. The Council on Competitiveness, this group in Washington, D.C., had a conference last week called the National Energy Summit, and it was full of lots of brave talk about how innovative and courageous we are, and how we're at the tipping point on energy and now it's time for America to embrace change and unleash our big brainy scientists and our bold, risk-taking entrepreneurs in the quest to tackle the next great challenge of our lifetimes, blah blah blah.
<p />So they put out this video (embedded below), which shows every president since Gerald Ford saying the <em>exact same goddamn thing that we're saying today</em>. Jesus! If we were as bad at IT as we are at energy (or as full of shit), the whole world would still be using computers that look like <a href="http://macadoodle.wordpress.com/2007/04/21/true-or-false-the-first-apple-computer-was-made-of-wood/" target="_blank">this</a>.
<p />I watched this video and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. We're fucked, people. Do you realize this? Forget about global warming. Pretend it doesn't exist. Forget too about the geopolitical lunacy of continuing to depend on foreign oil. Let's just talk about money, which is something we can all understand and worship.
<p />Alternative energy is the next big tech market, the one that will spawn the next Google, or Apple, or Microsoft. But guess what? Those companies probably won't be based here. As Thomas Friedman pointed out in his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/opinion/27friedman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">column </a>a few days ago, the Chinese are racing past us. They're investing billions -- in physics, in nanotech, in material science, in fuel cells, in solar. They're going to own this market.
<p />Meanwhile we sit here with our heads up our butts, debating things like a gas tax or whether power plant...</div>
