<p>Kirk and I took our dogs (Daisy and Mason) out for a walk.  We picked up one of the neighbors dogs along the way.  (The owner forgot to put on the dog's invisible fence collar.)  Our street ends at <a href="http://www.ci.rochester.ny.us/prhs/index.cfm?action=waterdetail&amp;type=fish&amp;id=70">Durand Park</a>.  Its about a quarter of a mile away from our house and a lot of people bring their dogs there for walks.  Once I get in the park, I often let Mason run off his leash so he can get the extra exercise.  He loves to run around like a crazed hound sniffing and smelling everything.  The neighbor's dog gave Mason an extra hard work out.  Fortunately he's slightly larger than Mason and was able to stand up to Mason's abuse.  I eventually had to put Mason back on his leash because he was getting too nippy.</div>
