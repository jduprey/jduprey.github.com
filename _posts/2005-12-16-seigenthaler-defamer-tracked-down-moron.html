<p>
<p>Of <i><b>course</b></i> you thought wikipedia was a gag site!&nbsp; What a moron.&nbsp; Ironically, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29" title="Wikipedia" target="">Chase now has a Wikipedia entry</a>.&nbsp; (Currently under consideration for deletion.)</p>
<p>
<p>Wikipedia has some detractors: <a href="http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/">http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/</a></p>
<p>
<p>I'm not a purist when it comes to the "right" of anonymity of the internet.&nbsp; In general, I think everyone should have to stand by what they say and do on the internet - as they should in "real life."&nbsp; However, there are times when doing that can get you killed or put in jail.. even here..&nbsp; Perhaps Wikipedia should work to get the users trust enough to privately manage identities.&nbsp; I believe that Wikipedia has already placed restrictions such that only registered users can create new pages.
