<p><em>I had heard of Evernote a while ago. Then recently, a friend said she was using it and couldn&rsquo;t live without it, so I thought it was time to give it a try. Boy, am I so glad I did! Evernote is such an open concept, that, at first, I had trouble figuring out where to start. Let me tell you how I have been using it, and share some tips on getting started. Hopefully, this will help you see some of the possibilities.</em></p>

<p>I use Evernote as a central repository for all my bookmarks, notes, receipts, etc. It syncs across computers, is avalable from the web, and has a good native iPhone app.  It's free and has a pro paid option.  It needs a better social feature set a la Delicious. (delicious.com) And, considering the info I store there, it should have more security options - encrypted notebooks instead of encrypted text.</p>
