<p>Linkin Park released a new album last week - "<a href="http://site.linkinpark.com/music/2012/living-things/">LIVING THINGS</a>". &nbsp;Its great. &nbsp;I love it, but I'm still addicated to their last album from two years ago - "<a href="http://site.linkinpark.com/music/2010/a-thousand-suns/">A Thousand Suns</a>". &nbsp;While "A Thousand Suns" was considered somewhat atypical for them, it had an epic feeling to it and is one of the few albums I listen to from front to back.</p>
<p>Here's "Waiting For The End" from that album.</p>
