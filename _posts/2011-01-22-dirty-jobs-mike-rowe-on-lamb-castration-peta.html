<p>I didn't know that Mike Rowe was so philosophical. Although I can totally see how biting the testicles off a lamb might evoke some deep thoughts about what the hell you are doing with your life. In the video he makes an argument for a return to manual labor. Skilled labor. Craftsmanship I can see. However, I still remember the repeated pleas from my parents to do well in school, get good grades and a good job so that I didn't have to work as hard as they did in factories and auto-body shops. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-udsIV4Hmc&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-udsIV4Hmc&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a>
