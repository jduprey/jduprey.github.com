<p>For being such a modern, forward-thinking browser, <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/tagged/google-chrome/">Google Chrome</a> still has a few rather curious feature omissions ??? like the ability to right-click an image and set it as your wallpaper, something just about every other browser around can do. Chrome also only recently <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/google-chrome-13-adds-instant-pages-and-print-preview-2011082/">added a print preview</a>, one other key feature it had been missing for the first 10-plus major releases.</p>
<p>One of Chrome???s strengths is its profile synchronization abilities. What began early on as a way to keep your bookmarks silently updated across all your Chrome installs evolved into something much more full-featured, syncing themes, extensions, apps, preferences, and just about everything else that makes your Chrome install <em>yours</em>. Now, one more piece of the sync puzzle is nearing readiness: your active tabs.</p>
<p>You???ll find the new option in bleeding-edge versions of Chrome (including the Dev Channel, Canary, and recent Chromium snapshot builds) on the about:flags page under ???enable syncing sessions.??? Once you???ve flipped the switch, relaunch Chrome and head to&nbsp;<a>chrome://settings/syncSetup</a>. The option ???Foreign Sessions??? will now appear in your sync options.</p>
<p>Check it out, and you???ll be able to enjoy a more seamless experience when changing computers and using Chrome. Power off your iMac and sign in on your 3G Chromebook, and Chrome will sync your last set of active tabs ??? letting you pick up right where you left off. It wouldn???t be a complete surprise to see this extended to the Android web browser at some point, especially since Chrome-to-Phone already allows a similar kind of syncing (albeit a more manual incarnation).</p>

<p>Looks like this is a hidden feature.  In my beta version (18.0.1025.151 beta), "Foreign Sessions" is now "Open Tabs".  I haven't yet seen how sync'ing of all open tabs on all my chrome browsers clashes..</p>
