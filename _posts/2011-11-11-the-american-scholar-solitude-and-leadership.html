<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">I don&rsquo;t like work&mdash;no man does&mdash;but I like what is in the work,&mdash;the chance to find yourself. Your own reality&mdash;for yourself, not for others&mdash;what no other man can ever know.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a great essay.  Above is a quote from "Heart of Darkness" that resonated with me.  I can relate to that a lot and is one of the reasons I work hard.</p>
<p>There are a number of points that really hit home.. and sometimes I wonder if I embody too many of these traits:&nbsp;"That&rsquo;s really the great mystery about bureaucracies. Why is it so often that the best people are stuck in the middle and the people who are running things&mdash;the leaders&mdash;are the mediocrities? Because excellence isn&rsquo;t usually what gets you up the greasy pole. What gets you up is a talent for maneuvering. Kissing up to the people above you, kicking down to the people below you. Pleasing your teachers, pleasing your superiors, picking a powerful mentor and riding his coattails until it&rsquo;s time to stab him in the back. Jumping through hoops. Getting along by going along. Being whatever other people want you to be, so that it finally comes to seem that, like the manager of the Central Station, you have nothing inside you at all. Not taking stupid risks like trying to change how things are done or question why they&rsquo;re done. Just keeping the routine going."</p>
<p>He also touches upon multitasking, media, etc. and the need for one to be alone, not influenced by outside sources, and think..</p>
