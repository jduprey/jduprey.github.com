<div class="entry-content">Wow!  We won again.  It was a very close game and I didn't think we were going to pull it off at first.  I scored the first goal and that seemed to grease the wheels for the rest of the team.  I failed to do anything else significant the rest of the game except suck wind.  Fortunately, we have a couple of guys that are in shape.  They kept the game going.
<p />Chris had some good saves and Mark really put the pressure both on defense and offense.  He scored at least 2 goals, maybe 3?  CJ, joined the team and had an assist for Mark's first goal.  We managed to get the lead late in the second half.  We fell back to a heavy defensive position and ran the clock out.

<p>Mac Daddy's had their own terminator on the field.  A girl with an exposed knee brace was inflicting pain on people left and right.  If we aren't supposed to wear jewelry I suspect a large, and apparently sharp, leg apparatus should not be allowed on the field exposed.  If she had put a knee pad on it and wore pants, she probably would have been OK.  The first time I encountered her knee brace, I thought, "Wow, she's built like a rock!"  Eventually I looked down at my knee and saw that it was bleeding.  See the picture to the left.  Once I get the blood cleaned off, I'm sure it won't look so nasty.  I suspect I'll have a long line of a bruise.  The ref. should have taken care of it but, even when I brought to his attention, he did nothing.
<p />I can't complain too much, in my own oxygen deprived state, I kicked a couple of people in the ankles.  aa<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma" title="Karma literally means &quot; or broadly the names cause principle more&gt;">Karma</a>.</div>
