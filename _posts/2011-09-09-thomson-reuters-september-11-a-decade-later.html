<p>On September 11, 2001, four hijacked planes were used to carry out the attacks on the United States. Two planes hit New York City&rsquo;s World Trade Center, a third plunged into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after an attempt was made by passengers to regain control. In total 2,992 people were killed.</p>
<p>Drawing on the past 10 years of Reuters news coverage, we invite you to watch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>9/11: Looking Back on Ten Years</strong>, a multimedia retrospective reflecting on the tragic events of that one day, while bearing witness to how lives around the globe have been&nbsp;forever changed.</p>
