<div>PrivacyFix is an extension for Chrome and Firefox to analyze your privacy settings for G+, Facebook, and other ad tracking sites. &nbsp;It then helps you change the settings by taking you directly to the g+ and fb settings in your browser. &nbsp;Sadly it isn't available for Safari nor IE??? but you aren't still using IE, are you? :)</div>
<p />
<div>I highly recommend that you try this tool out. &nbsp;Internet privacy gets complicated and Facebook, especially, doesn't make it easy to find and change your settings. &nbsp;PrivacyFix also does a nice job of expelling the ramifications of enabling/disabling each setting..</div>
