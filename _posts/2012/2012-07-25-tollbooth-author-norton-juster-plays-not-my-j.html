<div>Update: M and I did get to read it this summer and we really enjoyed it. &nbsp;(A lot of lessons about why learning isn't "dumb".) &nbsp;While we enjoyed it, <a href="http://blog.iduprey.com/lauren-ipsum">Lauren Ipsum</a> was by far her favorite. &nbsp;We read it twice this summer!</div>
<div>
<p>Norton - children understand more than adults realize. &nbsp;I hope to read this with M before the summer ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Tollbooth' Author Norton Juster Plays Not My Job
<p>NPR - July 21, 2012</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, a young architect named Norton Juster decided to procrastinate by writing a children's book; his roommate, a young cartoonist named Jules Feiffer, did all the illustrations. The result was The Phantom Tollbooth, which has since become a beloved children's classic.</p>
<p>Since Juster knows enough about The Phantom Tollbooth already, we've invited him to answer three questions about The Phantom Menace. [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>
