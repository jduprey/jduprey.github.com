<div>I got a little teary eyed when this photo popped across my <a href="http://memolane.com/">memolane</a>.. &nbsp;She's so happy there.. I can remember that night.. &nbsp;It seems memolane serves mostly as a way to resurface my memories (via e-mail) that I then forward around to my friends and family. &nbsp;This one of my daughter all cuddled up in her sleeping bag was just too cute. I had to share.</div>
