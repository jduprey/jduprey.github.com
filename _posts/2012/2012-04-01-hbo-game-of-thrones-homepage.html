<p>I'm subscribing to HBO just for the "Game of Thrones" series.  Very seldom does a series inspire me to pay MORE for my video entertainment.  (It also inspired me to read the books - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)</a>  I just found out HBO is  $14.95/mo.  I'm pretty sure when I last cancelled HBO, it only saved me an additional $6.  How is it that adding it back costs me more than when I dropped it?  I'm also curious about HBO GO.  Anyway, the plan is to drop HBO after the Game of Thrones season ends.</p>
