<p>Posterous has been acquired by Twitter.  Their only words of comfort for long time Posterous users is essentially 'Don't worry, we'll let your export your data.'    How about 'There are no plans at this time to change the level, quality, or type of service.'  Or 'Twitter and Posterous have some exciting plans for the service that will likely enhance your already great Posterous experience.'  I can only conclude that they really don't have any plans for Posterous at this time, unlikely, or that the plans they have will eventually involve integrating the Posterous platform into Twitter somehow which may or may not herald the end of our personal blogs as we know it.</p>
